300 ORATION OF AESCHINES

the Rights of public Hospitality3 Leodamas‚ not a less power-
ful, and in my Judgement, a sweeter Orator, than Demosthe·
nes 3 Archidemus, an able Speaker, and who had exposed him-
self to very many Dangers in the Course of his Administration
by his Zeal for the Thebans 3 your favourite Demagogue‚
Aristophon, so long accused of being almost a Boeotian, and the
Orator Pyrander‚ who is still alive. Yet none of them were
ever able to influence that People‚ and incline them to enter
into your Alliance. The Cause of their Refusal, Ivery well
know, but shall not mention it, out of the Respe& I bear to
their Misfortunes. Yet I imagine, when Philip had taken
away Nicaea from them, and ceded it to the Theffalians3 when
he had again brought back that very War, which he had him-

self originally removed beyond the Frontiers of Boeotia, even

to the Walls of Thebes 3 lastly, when he had seized‚ and for-
tified, and put a Gan-ison into Elataea; then the Terrours of
their own immediate Danger alarmed them, and they irnplored
the Succour of Athens. You instantly took the Field‚ and

marched in Arms, both Cavalry and Infantry, into Thebes, be-
fore Demosthenes had written a single Syllable upon the Alli-
ance. Thus the Conjuneture itself, and its Terrours, and the

Neceffity of your Affistance, not Demosthenes, or his Eloquence,
vintroduced you into Thebes. :For in the Transaffion of this Affair
he committed, with Regard to your Interests, three very capital

Erronrs. First, when Philip carried on only a nomina] War against
ns, and in Reality was animated with a much more violent Resent-
