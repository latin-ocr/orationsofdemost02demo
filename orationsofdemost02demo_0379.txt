IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 367

the Administration, you were at first well inclined to affist that
People, though conscious how unjustifiable their Condueffl
You would have taken Pleasure in any Misfortune‚ that might
have happened to the T hebans; neither was your Resentment
against them unreasonable or unjust, for they had not used with
Moderation the Advantages they gained at Leuetra. Pelopon-
nesus was divided into Parties. The Enemics of the Lacedae-
monians could neither totally subdue that People, nor could
the Governors, whom they had established, any longer main-
tain their Authority in their several Cities, while not among
the Peloponnefians only, but all the other States of Greece,
there was a secret Spirit of Discord and Confufion, that appa-
rently must soon break out into open War. &Philip observing
these Disorders (for they were eafily to be observed) profusely
l-avishes his Treasures to corrupt particular Traitors in every
single State3 then throws them all into Confufion, and amidst
the universal Commotion urges them to their mutual Destrueti—
onst* Thus, while some Were greatly criminal, and others
equally imprudent, Philip carried his Defigns into Execution‚

and became the general Terrour of Greece. As it was evident‚
that thel Thebans, exhausted by the Length of the Phocaean·
War (the Thebans, at that Time, imprae‘ticable and insolent‚

though now most unfortunate, and depreffed) must have been
compelled to fly to you for Succours, Philip, thatsuch a Measure
might not take Effe& and that the two Republics should noe

unite in Interests and Alliance, prom—ised Peace to Yon, and
Affistance
