AESCHINES. 161

He then attempted to compare me to Dionyfius, the Siciliam

Tyrant, (7) and afterwards with Violence and Clamour bids you
beware of that wild Monster‚ AEschines. T hen he repeated
the Dream of the Woman of Himera, yet when he had carried
the Affair to such a pitch of Extravagance, he envied me the

Honour of these Calumnies, and ascribed the Cause of all our
MisfortuneS, not to my orations, but to the Arms of Philip.

Bur besides his Impudence, and the portentous Falsehoods

this Comparison between AEschines and this KVomarm that she dreamt she was

Dffinyfius, or the Ridicule of mention· carried to Heaven, and there saw a Man
ing this Himerian Woman's Dream, chained under the Throne of Jupiter;
since neither of them appear in the and when ssie afterwards saw Dionysum,
Oration of Demosthenes. Valerius Max· ssie tried out, 'I hat is the Man.
