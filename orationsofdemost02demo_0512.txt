FOT) DEMOSTHENES

D
Bur you applaud the illustrious Charaaers of former Ages3
antl with Justice applaud. It is however unjust‚ O Men of
Athens, to take Advantage of that Veneration you bear the
Dcad, and then examine my Conduc't, who am yet living
among yOU, in Comparison with theirs. Is there a Man upon
Earth, who is ignorant, that a certain Proportion of Envy al-
ways attends the Living; whereas the dead are no longer hated
even by their Enemies? Since therefore such is the Condition
of human Nature, ἶ lhall Ι be tried and examined by Compari—
son with those, who lived before me? No, certainly. It
were neither just, nor equitable. Let me be compared with
you, AEstbines, or any others you think proper, who have
chosen to ἃᾶ upon your PrincipleS, and who are still alive?
Consi-der besides, whether it is niore honourable and advanta-
geous sor the Republic, while she gratefully remembers the
Serviccs performed by your Ancestors (the Greatness of which
undoubtedly excecds all Power of Expreffion) to treat with In
gratitudo and lnsult those she at present receives 3 or whether
every (Tirizeii, whose Affeehon to the State hath appeared in
any of his Aetions, should have some Share in the Honours
bestowed by the Public, and in the Favour of these his

Countrynien. However, Ι dare affirm, fince I am compelled

to use this Language‚ thatme Conduetin Ministry‚ and my

CounselS, if examincd with Candour, will appear not rneanly

to resemble the Administration of those great Men, so justly
celebrated, and to be calculated for the same glorious Purposes;
