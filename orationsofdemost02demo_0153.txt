DEMOSTHENES. 141

of Battles and Trophie8‚ on a sudden, as soon as he had landcd
in Macedonia, spoke in direct conti-adierim to his former Ha-
rangues 3 that we should no longer remember our Ancestors,

nor talk of their Trophies, nor send Succours, nor enter into
Council with the other States of Greece, and only not rase her

Cities ourselves. Expreffions‚ so full of Turpitude, were
never uttered in your Affemblies. For among either Greeks

or Barbarians is there so perverse, so stupid, so virulent an
Enemy to the Republic‚ that if he were asked3 “ tell me, is

“ there any Part of Greece, such as it now appears, and inha-
“ bited as it is at present, that could have either preserved its
“ Name, or been inhabited by Grecians, if our Ancestors had

“ not given such fignal Proofs of their Virtue at Marathon and
‘⁶ Salamis ?” No one, Ι am persuaded, would affert it could3
but on the contrary, that the whole Country must have been
subdued by the Barbarians. Those Honours therefore, those
Praises, of which even your Enemies would not deprive you,
AEschines, that he may receive his Penfion‚ will not suffer you,
the Descendants of those Ancestors, even to mention. Of all

other Bleffings the Dead cannot participate, but Praise for the
glorious Aeuom, which they died in performing‚ is their pecu—
liar Property, nor after Death does Envy itself oppose their

Poffeffion. He therefore, who despoils them of these Honours5
may justly be deprived of his own Dignity, while your Justice

will appear in thus revenging your Ancestors.
