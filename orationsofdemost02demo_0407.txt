IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 395

Public 3 those very Ambafl‘adors, whom the Athenians violent-
ly drove out of the City, and considered as EnemieS, who
neither offered Proposals just in themselves, or advantageous to
the Commonwealth. These Enemies, however, of the Re-
public, were the Friends of AEschines. Are not these Things
true, thou Slanderer? Thou, who hast afferted, that I re—
ceive my Bribe‚ and am silent, but grow clamorous, whenI

have lavished it away. Not such however is your Praetice.

You are clamourouS, even when you receive, nor will ever stop
those clamourS, unless our Judges impose an eternal Silence

upon you, by branding you this Day with Infamy. (8)

< Bur when I was crowned for these Services by your order,
when Aristonicus proposed a Decree‚ in the very same TermS,
that Ctefiphon harh now used (for this is the second Time these

Honours have been conferred upon me) AEschines, though
present, never opposed it, or indified the Person, who prefer-
red it. Read the Decree.

The DECREE.

UND ER the Archonship of Chaerondas, on the twenty-fifth Day

of January, the Leontidean Tribe prefiding in the Senate, Ari-
stonicus delivered this Opinion ε Whereas Demosthenes hath
rendered many and important Services to the People of Athens;

E e e 2 main·

(8) The Person, condemned under the ble of pleading in any Court of Judi·
Penalty of Infamy, was for ever incapa- cature.
