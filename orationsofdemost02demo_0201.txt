AESCHrNES. 189

Philip marched into Thrace3 but he promised us not to invade
Chersonesus, while the Peace was under your Consideration.
In that very Day, therefore, in which you decreed this Peace,
there was not the least Mention made of Chersobleptes. When
we were afterwards appointed to demand Philip’s Oath, nor
had yet set forward upon our second Embaffy, an Affembly
was summoned, of which Demosthenes, who now accuses me,
was elec‘ted Prefident. In this Affembly Critobulus declared,
he was sent by Chersobleptes, and defired, that he might be
allowed to tender the Oaths to Philip’s Ambaffadors, and that
'the Name of Chersobleptes might be enrolled among your Con-—
federates. (21) When he had made this Declaration, Alex-
imachus‚ of the Pelegian Tribe, gave a Decree to the Prefidents
of the Affembly to be read, in which it was resolved, that
CritobuluS, in Conjune‘tion with your other Consederates, might
tender the Oaths to Philip. When this Decree was read, as
1 presume you all remember, Demosthenes rose from among
the PrefidentS, and declared, that he would not propose
this Decree to the People, nor diffolve the Peace with Philip,

nor acknowledge such Confederates‚ as acted like People, who
have no other Concernment in a sacrifice, than to partake of
its Libations: but that, however, he would appoint another

Affembly to take the Affair into Consideration. When you
received

(21) That as the Athenians and their tobulus might be allowed to do in the
Allies administered the Oaths of Ratifi- Name of Chersobleptes, as one of their·
