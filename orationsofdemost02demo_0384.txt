372 DEMOSTHENES

no such Order ever were given? Ought I rather to have been
anxious to save this little Pittance‚ or, like these Trators, have

sold the whole Republic to Philip? Take and read this De·-
cree, which AEschines‚ apparently conscious of its Importance„

hath passed over in Silencel
The DECREE.

UNDER the Archonffiip of Mnefiphilus, on the thirtieth Day
of July, the Pandionian Tribe being Prefidents of the Counci13.
Demosthenes delivered this Opinione WHEREAS Philip hath
sent an Embaffy to Athens to negotiate a Peaee, of which he

hath ratified certain preliminary Articles3 it therefore seemeth
good to the Senate and People of Athens, in Order, that this
Peace‚ approved of in the first general Affembly, may belfinally,
concluded, that five Ambaffadors be elected out of the whole

Body of our Citizens, and when their Election is confirmed,

that they depart without Delay to whatever Place they are in- -

formed Philip shall reside, and there interchange the Oaths of

Ratification, according to the Articles of Convention between?
Him and the Athenian People, mutually including their com-

mon Confederates. Eubulus, AEschines, Ctesiphon, Demo-

crates, and Cleon, are appointed Ambaffadors.

WHEN in- my Zeal. for the Interests of the Commonwealth,
certainly not those of Philip, Ihad preferred this Decree, your
very excellent Ambaffadors, little solicitous forits Success, sat

down
