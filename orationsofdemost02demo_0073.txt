Lm· it be therefore your Care, that the Punilhrnent you

denounce upon him may be adequare to such Crimes. For
were it not the highest Degree of Turpitude, O Men of Athens,
after you have publicly and universally condemned the conse-
quences of this Peace, and refused to participate in the Decrees
of the Amphistyons3 when you have held Philip in Detestation,
and suspected him, as if all his Afflons were impious and

cruel; unjust in themselves, and to you most injurious, yet
when you have entered this Court of Judicature to pronounce

Sentence upon the Accounts laid before you concerning these

Transastion33 when you have taken an Oath to judge accord-
ing to the Interests of the Republic, were it not the utmost

Degree of Turpitude‚ that the Author of all these Mischiefs‚
whom you have openly surprised in the very Perpetration of
them, should be acquitted? Will not our other Citizens, or
rather will not the Grecians in general, when they behold you

angry with Philip, who by making Peace in the midst of War‚
and by purchafing the Assistance of those, who are accustomed
to sell their Abilities, does a Thing which really admits of

much Excuse‚ will they not justly blame you, if you after·
wards aequit this Man, who hath basely betrayed your Interests 3
especially while there are Laws in being, that appoint the last

Punishment for such Crimes?
