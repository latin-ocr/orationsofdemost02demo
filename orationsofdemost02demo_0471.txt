bans on that memorable Day, in the Sight of all Mankmd‚ give
you three the most illustrious Proofs of their Esteem 3 the first
with regard to your Courage, the second to your justice, and

Mankind with greatest Attention, their Children and their

theirs were united3 *in that, near the *River Cephiffu83 the

Discipline, and Appointme11t8‚ and Alacrity of your Troop8.

fices, and ordered Processions to the Gods for your Success.

Here therefore I would gladly demand of AEschines, during

these SolemnitiCS, when the City was full of Triumph and Ex-
N n n 2 ultation,
