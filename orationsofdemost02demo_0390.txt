petrated these Mischiefs, demanded should instantly be delivered
up to his Resentment‚ now certainly rejoice in their De-
strufflon.

Embaffy had sold themselves to his Service, and had never made*

Phocaeans had also been deceived, and their Cities rased to the·

Ground, what followed? The abominable Thessaliam, and
stupid Thebans imagined him their Friend, their Benefaetor,

their Saviour. He was every thing to them ς nor would they:

listen to the Man, who seemed to infinuate the contrary. ὁ Al-
