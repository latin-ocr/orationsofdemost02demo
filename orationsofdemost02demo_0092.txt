So ORATIONS OF

Now behold in what Manner AEschines and Philocrates aeted
during this period, for their Aetions will be better seen, when
set in Opposition to each other. First‚ they declared that the
Phoeaeans, salense}7 and Chersobleptes should not be included in
the Articles of Peace. This they did in Contradiffion to your
Deme, and the Ass‘urances they themselves had given you.
They afterwards attempted to invalidate and alter the Decree,
by which we vvere appointed Ambaffadors. Then they inserted
the Cardians in the Treaty, as Philip’s Confederates‚ and de-
termined not to send you my Lenem, but sent their own, with?
not one Syllable of Truth. Yet the generous AEschines decla-
red, that I had promised Philip to destroy your Democraey,
because I blamed their Condua, not only conceiving it infa-
mous in itself', but apprehenfive of my being involved with them

in one common Ruin. Yet AEschines never ceased from having
his private Conferences with Philip. Other Instanees Ι pass
over in Silence, but Dercyllus, not I, observed him one Night
at Pherae, and having this Slave of mine with him, surprised
him going out of Philip's Tent, ancl ordered the Slave to tell
me, and to remember it himself. In fine, this abandoned and
fhameless 'l‘raitor was N ight and Day, when we vvere dismiffed,
left alone with Philip. To prove the T ruth of what I affirm,

Ι will insert my own Testimony in the public RecordS‚ and

{iibseribe my Name to it, under the Penalty of any future Pro-
secution.
