DEMOSTHENES. 101

Citizens, if I maintained my Integrity, might be honoured by
you, and distinguished above the Vulgan and that Inever should
exchange my Zeal sor your Service for any possible Advantage.
But Ι hated these Ambaffadors, because Ι saw them aftiug mi-
quitoussy towards you, and impioussy to the Gods in their
Embafsy; because I was deprived, by their rapacious Corruption‚

of the Honours I personally merited, while you treated the whole

Embaffy with equal Indignation. But looking forward to Futu-
rity, and willing that you should determine in this ‚Trial, and

at this Tribunal, that our Actions were totally different, I now

accuse, and summon them to render the ufilal Account of their

Conduc‘h I am, however, apprehenstve, greatly apprehenfive,
(for all my Thoughts shall be laid before you) that you then
included me, though perfectly guil-tless, in the Suspicion of
their Crimes, and are now extremely inattentive to my Inno-
cence. For to me you appear, O Men of Athens, absolutely·
diffolved in Indolence and expecting your Missortunes with
Indifference. When you behold others labouring in Distoess,
you are neither concerned for their Safety‚ nor anxious for the
Republic, that harh been long injured in so various and outrass
gious a Manner. Do you not think it terrible and monstrous
what I am going to relate? sor although Ι had determined to
be silent, yet I arn forced to speak. You all know Pythocles.
I had long lived with him in every Kind of Intimacy, nor did
any thing unfriendly ever happen between us even to this Day.
