532 ORATIONSOF

Peace, and defended the Cause of Philocrates; that he wasted
away the Time, untill it was impoffible for you, however de-
termined, to march to the relief of the Phocaeans3 that he com-
mitted many other, and atrocious Crimes during our Journey3
betraying, selling every thing, receiving Bribes, nor leaving any
one Kind of Villainy unattempted. I have therefore demon-
strated what I promised at the Beginning.

Now consider what followed3 for the Remainder of this O-
ration will be perfeetly fimple. You have sworn to decree ac-
cording to the Laws, the Resolutions of the People, and those
of the Senate. Yet AEschines appears to have ever afted through
the whole Embaffy in Contradietion to these Laws, these De-
erees, and to every Sentiment of Justice. He must therefore,
by wise and upright Judges, be certainly condemned. Were
he guilty of no other Crime, two of his Aetions were sufficient
to pronounce Sentence of Death upon him3 for he betrayed
not only the Phocaeans, but Thrace, to Philip, although it
were impoffible to shew two Places in the World of more im-
portance to the Republic, than Thermopylae by Land, and the
Hellespont by Sea3 both of which he basely sold, and ruinoussy,
with regard to your Interests, delivered into the Hands of Phi-
lip. How flagitious, therefore, was the Crime, even without
any other, to abandon Thrace, and its Fortreffes? A thou-
sand lnstances might be given of Persons put to Death by you-1·
