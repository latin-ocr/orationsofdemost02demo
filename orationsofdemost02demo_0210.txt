198 ORATION OF

“ have certainly mentioned it in this Decree. However‚ in
“ the uncertainty of the Event, they left the Explanation of
“ this Affair to their Ambaffadors‚ who poffibly might be able
“ to prevail upon Philip, and they determined to make the
“ Experiment in our Persons. Yet it becomes whoever is
⁴< studious of the public Welfare‚ not to invade the Province
“ of others, whom the People might have sent instead of us,
“ and to be cautious of giving Offence to the Thebans; one
“ of whom, their General Epaminondas, unawed by the Dig-
“ nity of the Athenians, expressly declared in a Theban As·-
“ sembly, that the Arcade of the Athenian Citadel should be

“ carried to Thebes, and placed before the Temple of

‘⁶ Cadmus.’'

WHILE I was thus speaking, Demosthenes, as all our Col-
leagues know, eries out aloud‚ “ In addition to our other

“ Misfortunes this AEschines is an errant Boeotian.” Among

“ This Man is
“ fond of wild and dangerous Proje&s 3 while I confess rny-

(25) It was the politica} Interest of
Athens to repress the Power of Thebes,
and for that Purpose to restore the Citius
of Boeotia. AEschines must therefore
very absurdly charge Demosthenes with
favouring the ssaeotians, yet thus our
great Transsator and his Commentators
understand him. Περὶ τὲς Rome& σνςϊ-
δείξει ὁ Δημοσθένης. Ἰ hus the Rufinu-
ing of both these supposed Speeches
becomes confused, and our Orator

argues against himself. The seeming
Prudence of not provoking the Thebans3
the invidious Manner of telling the Story
of 1⁴]p211ninonda5‚ so apt to provoke the
Indignation of his Audience3 the A rt of
making Demosthenes reproach him with
his Zeal for the Boeotians in the Boldness
of his Projeess, the Timidity under which

he represents his Adversary, are totally
lost.
