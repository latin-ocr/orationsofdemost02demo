DEMOSTHENES. 147

(luced, or their Insolence and Arrogance suppreffed, the Citics of
the Phocaeans, your Consederates, were rased to the Ground;
the Thebans rased them to the Ground, and their Inhabirants
were dispersed by the Harangues of AEschines3 instead of dcli-
vering up Eubaea in Exchange for Amphipolis, Philip is raifing
Fortresses in Eubaea, from whence to invade you, and is per-
petually meditating the Siege of those Places we still poffess in
that Issand: instead of having Oropus restored, we are now
“ preparing to march for the Defence of our own F rontiers, which,
while the Phocaeans were in Safety, we had never done: instead
of performing their ancient, customary Sacrifices at Delphos,
⁴ and having his Treasures restored to Apollo, the rightful Am-
phistyons are compelled to Hy, are driven into Banishment, and
their Country laid waste3 while these barbarian Macedoniam,
who never had a Seat before among the Amphictyons, now
attempt by Force to enter into that Council. Whoever menti-
ons the sacred Treasures is instantly crucified3 the Republic is
despoiled of her Prerogative of first consulting the Oracle at
Delphos, and all her Affairs are perplexed and confused like
an AEnigma. Thus Philip never told an Untruth, yet carried
all his Schemes into Execution, while you beheld whatever you
prayed and hoped for, in every Instance contradidz‘ted‚ and
under an Appearance of Peace suffered more direful Calamities,

1han under an open Declaration of War. By such Prafflces did
these Traitors get Money‚ and yet are even to this D'ay unpu-

nished.
