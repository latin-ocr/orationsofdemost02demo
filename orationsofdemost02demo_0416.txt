404 DEMOSTHENES

Noa with regard to the Laeedaemonians only did you behave‘
yourselves in this Manner, but when the Thebans invaded Eu-
boea, you did not indolently behold that Event, nor remember
how you had been injured by Themison, and Theodorus in the
Affair of Oropus, but succoured and relieved them. It was at
this Period, that our citizens, among whom I havea Right of
being numbered, first voluntarily offered themselves to the Re—
public to support the Expenee of fitting out your Gallies.
Eut of this Matter hereafter. Yet however glorious your pre-
serving that lssand, still more glorious, when you became abso-
lute Masters of its Cities and the Lives of their Inhabitants, that
you honourably restored them to those, by whom you vvere thus

injured, without demanding an Account of their Injustice,
when they had placed this Confidence in your Integrity. A

thousand other Instances Ι pass over unmentioned3 the Sea-

fights, Expeditions, Battles, in which, both formerly and within
our Memory, the Republic engaged, in Support of the Liberties
and Interests of Greece. When Ι beheld Her, upon so many and
‚ such important Oecafions, voluntarily entering into these Contests
in Defence of others, what Counsel should Ihave proposed, what
Advice should 1 have given, where her own Safety was in some
Measure under her Confideration? To remember her Resent-
ments against those, forbid it Jupiter! who now solicited her
Prote-&ion 3 and to seek for Pretences, by which we should
have betrayed the common Cause of Liberty ? Might not any of
our Citizens have been justified in killing me, if Ι had attempted„
even·
