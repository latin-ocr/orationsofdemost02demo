AGAINST CTESIPHON. 331

mosthenes hath made 3 when he tedioussy consumes your Time,
nor offers one reasonable Argument in his Defence, desire him,
without Noise or Tumult to take this Table of our Laws, and
compare it with his own Decree. If he pretends not to hear
you, determine not to hear Him3 for you do not come hither
to listen to them, who would avoid an equitable Trial‚ but to
them, who are willing to rely upon the Justice of their De-
fence. But if he irregularly refuses to plead his own Cause,
and calls Demosthenes to his Aid} be greatly cautious of admit-
ting this Author of Mischief‚ who presumes, he shall be able
by the meer Power of Words to subvert your Laws. When
Ctesiphon therefore defires your Leave to call Demosthenes, let
not any Man account it Matter of Merit, to be the first, who
shall clamoroussy repeat “ Call hirn3 call him.'’ For you
call him against yourselves; you call him against the Laws3

you call him against your Democracy.

IF however you think proper to hear him, at least require of
him to make his Defence in the fame OrderI have observed in
his Accusation. But indeed (that I may engage you to recol-
lect) what Order have Ι observed in accusing him? I neither

entered, at first, into his private Life, nor mentioned his pub-
lic OffenceS, although Ι might surely find abundant Proofs a·-
gainst him, if I be not of all Mankind the simplest. *But I

first laid before you the Laws, which expressly forbid Ctefi-

phon to crown the Cidzeu, who hath not been legally discharg-
