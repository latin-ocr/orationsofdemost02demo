DEMOST‘HENES. 7

I'imagine, that whoever hathonce received a bribe3 whocver
hath been once corrupted, will never be a safe and upright
Judge, where the Interests of the Republic arc concerned.

11: Ι can therefore manifestly demonstrate, that AEschines
hath not uttered one fingle Truth in the Reports of his Em*-
baffy3 that he hindered the People from being informed by.
me of the real State of their Affairs ; that he hath ever advised
You in dire& Oppofition to your Interests; that he harh not
executed those Instructions, with which he was charged in his
Embaffy3· that he idly wasted the Time, in which many fa—
vourable ConjundfflreS, and those in Affairs of utmost Impor-
tance‚ were treacheroussy lost to the Republic; that he and
Philocrates have received Presents, and even Bribes‚ from Phi-
lip 3 if Ι prove these Accusations, let him be condemned3 let
him suffer a Punishment, proportioned to his Guilt. Is, οη
the contrary, I cannot demonstrate these Facis, estecm me a

Calumniator, and let him be acquitted. But although l might
accuse him, besides these, of many other cnormous offences,

OMen of Athens, which would justly render him an Objecl:
of your universal Detestation‚ yet I rather choose, before I
enter upon my future Proofs, to recall to your Remembrance
(fincel am affured many of you can easily remember) what
Rank AElchines affumed to himself upon his Entrance into the·
AdministratiOn, and what Kind of Harangues he held it ne·-
ceffary for him to make against Philip in every Ass'embly of the

People7
