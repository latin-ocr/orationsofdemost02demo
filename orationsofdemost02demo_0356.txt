344 ORATION OF AESCHINES

having performed many fignal Services for his Country, and
being little powerful in his Elocution, envies the Talents of
his Adversaries. He is conscious of his own Inability to describe
with Advantage those Actions, he had worthily performed, while
lie beholds his Accuser enabled by his Eloquence to convince
his Audience of the Reality of those ActionS, which ina Truth

·he never performed. But when a Man absolutely compacted
of Words; the Words of Bitterness‚ and chosen with exquisite

Curiosity3 that such a Man should pretend to rely upon an
artless Simplicity of speaking, ora meer Representation of F ac‘ts,
is it not most intolerable? A Man, whose Tongue is his only
Merit. Take that away, the Remainder of him is as worthless‚

as a tongueless Pipe. (40)

I REALLY wonder, Athenians, and would gladly know, up—
on what Motives you will aequit Ctesiphon of this IndiCtment?
Because his Decrec is agreeable to your Laws? Nothing was

ever more illegal. Because he merits not the Trouble of pu·
nishing ? you never can have any Rules to direct the Lives and

Manners of our People‚ if this Man is acquitted. But is it not
truly deplorable‚ that formerly this Orchestra was filled with
Crowns of Gold, presented by the States of Greece to the Peo-
ple of Athens upon this Day, appointed to receive them with

greater Solemnity, and now, when by the unhappy Politics of
Demost-

(40) Athin Plate, cut in the Shape of the Pipe; perhaps not unlike the
ms a Tongue, was fixed in the Mouth Reeds of our Hautboys.
