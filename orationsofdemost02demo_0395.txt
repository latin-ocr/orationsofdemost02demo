IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 383

did‘tment‚ and recount to you my Condust in Administration,
that AEschines, however conscious of their Truth already, may
hear upon what Reasons Ι hold myself worthy not only of this
Decree of the Senate, but even of greater HonourS. Read the

Indifiment.
The INDICTMENT.
UNDER the Archonship of Chaerondas, the fixth of March,
AEschines laid before the Archon an Indid'mnent against Cte-

fiphon, for a Decree preferred by him in Oppofition to our
established LanJ and importing‚ “ that Demosthenes should

“ be crowned with a golden Crown‚ and Proclamation thereos
‘5 made in the Theatre‚ during the Festival of Bacchus, When.
“ the new Tragedians were to appear upon the Stage : that the
“ People crovvned him for his singular Merit3 for the Zeal he
“ bath constantly preserved towards the State's of Greece in
“ general, and particularly the Athenian People ε lastly, for
“ his Magnanimity, and because in all his Words and Afiions
“ he hath endeavoured with Ardour and Alacrity to support
“ the Constitution to the utmost of his Abilities.” ‘This In-
di&ment affirmS, that every Article of this Decree is salse, and
a dire& Violation of those Laws, which forbid any Falsehood
to be inserted in our public Records 3 or that the Person should

be crowned‚ who hath not yot given in his Accounts: that

Demost-

hazardous Qestion, which, it seems, other Accounts of this Matter are un-
was answered, as he wished, by some of worthy of our Author, aud ridiculous
the Judges‚ who afterwards condemned in themselve33 consequently not worm
AEschineS, or perhaps by sorne of our repeating„

orator's Party among the People. All.
