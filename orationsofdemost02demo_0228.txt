Timarchus, that all Mankind had heard of the Infamy of his
hnpuriries: that Hestod, an excellent Ροεῖ, says,

What all repert can never be a Lie,

And horn a Goddess‚ Fame can never die:

that this Goddess now comes to accuse me, for all Mankind
affirm, l have taken Bribes from Philip. But you are well
comdnced, Affienians, that there isamighty Difference between
Fame and Caiumny. Fame hath nothing in common With
Prosecutions, but Prosecutions are nearly allied to Calumny. Ι
will define each of them exaffly. Fame is the voluntary As-
sertion, without any particular Motive‚ of a Multitude of

Citizens concerning the Commiffion of any certain Fan. But?
Calumny is an Accusation maintained by some fingle Person in
the Presence of the Many, whether in our Affemblies, or the
Senate. To Fame we publicly offer Sacrifices, as to a G0d;
but we publicly prosecute Calumniators, as Wretches most im—

pious. Do northen, Demosthenes, confound things of highest
Excellence with those of extreme Turpitude.

I SUFFERED with Grief and Indignation several Articles of
this Indi-chnenss but especiaily when he chargedrne With being
a Traitor to my Country3 for if I could be convieted of this
Crime alone, I must appear a very Monster, unfeeling of all
natural Affefflon, and formerly guilty of many other Crimes.
Of my general Com-se of Life, and even my daily Manner of
living, I do imagine you are very sufficient Witneffes.' Yet
