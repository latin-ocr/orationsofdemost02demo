194 ORATION OF

accuse me of Corrupt10n‚ you, who suffered a Fine to be in-
fliete-d upon you by the Areopagus for not prosecuting the Ac-
tion of Battery you had laid against your Gordiu-German,
although you had yourself broken your own Head? And do
you now presume to talk to us with an Air of Importance‚ as if

we did not know you to be the Bastard Son of Demosthenes
die Sword-Cutler?

Bu'r you have attempted to prove, that befides abjuring the Em-

baffy to the Amphi&yons I aered in Violation of my Charaeter
as an Ambaffador. (2 5) Toffithis Purpose you have recited one

Decree, and paffed over another. But when I was appointed
Ambaffador to the Amphistyons‚ although I was then in a very
languid State of Heakh, yet with much Chearfulness I made
you my Report of the Embaffy, from which I had returned,

nor did Iabjure the other, but promised to under-take it, if Ι
were able. When my Colleagues were departing‚ I sent my
Brother with my NepheW, and my Phyfician, to the Senate,

not to abjure the Office in my Name (for the Laws do not allow
us to abjure in the Senate an E1nploym2ent conferred upon us by

the People) but to declare my ill State of Health. Yet when
my Colleagues heard the Misfortunes, that had befallen the

Phocaeam, and were returned, an Affernbly was summoned, at
which I was present, now perfefily recovered from my Disorder,

and the Peopleinfisting, that we should all engage in this third
r Embafl}²
