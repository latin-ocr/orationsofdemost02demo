AGAINST CTESIPHON. 341
may flatter yourself perhaps, that the People no longer remem-
ber them. But what Length of Time can ever hide in Oblivion
your Rapines in our Navy ? When you proposed a Law foi·
fitting out three hundred Gallies, and persuaded the Athenianz
to make you chief Dimitor of their Marine, I then convitsted
you of having robbed our Trierarchs of a Sum sufficient to have
equipped fixty-five light armed Gallies, and thus defrauded the

Republic of a greater Fleet‚ than that with which the Atheni-

ans won the signal Victory over the LacedaemonianS, aud their·
Admiral Pollis.

YET so strongly have you intrenched yourself in Calumnies
and Accusations against the Punissiment you deserve, that there

.. is less Danger for the CriminaI, who defends, than for them,
who make the Attack 3 while by perpetually bringing Alexan-
der and Philip into your Declamations‚ with abundant Invec-

tives against them, and by accufing some of our Citizens of
retarding the Operations of the Commonwealth in her most
favourable Conjune'cures, you really lost every then present Oc-

cafion of aeting, yet with many a vain-glorious Promise for the
future. Lastly‚ when Ι had resolved to bring you to a Trial,
did you not contrive to have Anaxinus, a Merchant then pur-

chasmg Goods at Olympias, arrested? You ordered him to
be put to the Torture‚ having first with your own Hand writ—

ten the Decree, that condemned him to suffer Death. Yet
with this very Man you lived at Oreum3 you eat, you drank,
