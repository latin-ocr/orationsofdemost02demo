termined, to grant the Republic Time for their future Counsels·
and a Truce until May. The SenatorS, Simus, Euthydemus, the

ANOTHER DECREE.
UNDER the Archonship of HeropythUS, on the thirtieth of
April, the Commander in Chief of our Forces made this Mo-
tion; whereas Philip harh attempted to alienate the Thebans

from us, and is now preparing to make an Irruption With all
his Forces into a Country fituated upon the Frontiers of Attica,
in open Violation of the Treaties sufisting between us3 it there-
fore seemeth good to the Senate and People to send an Herald

and Ambaffador to expostulate with him, and exhort him to
grant us a Truce, that the People may deliberate upon this
Exigency 3 because they have not yet determined to send him
any the least Succoum, in his War against the Amphiffaeans. (21)
The Senators, Nearchus, and Polycrates were chosen Ambas-

sadors; and EunomUS‚ the Plebeian, was appointed Herald.

and the Menae—es, with which it is con· not yet determined to send him the Succours
cludcd. These were probably levelled he demanded. The Paffage is acknOW-
at the Athenians particularly3 and we ledged desperate, and incapab1e‚ says
now see him marching towards Athens, 1)οᾶοΓ Taylor, of any Sense yet given
as ὶζ to put these Menaces into Exccuti- to the Words.
