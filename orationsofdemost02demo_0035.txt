Phocaeans were by him and AEschines expressly excluded from.
the Capitulation3 whereas all Mention of them should have
been paffed over in Silence and omitted, if it were intended
to preserve them: secondly, because neither Philip's Ambas-

aPromise. Having formed my Conjeclures upon these Cir—
cumstances‚ Irose and came forward on the Tribunal, and en-
deavoured to contradi& him. But when you refused to hear,
I kept Silence, entering only this Protest (which by all the
Gods I conjure you to remember) thatI neither knew these

Promises‚ nor had any Share in the Intrigues of your Ambas-
sadors3 I added, neither didv I expe& any good Success from
them. When you· received the Expreffio n, that Ι did not
expect any SuccesS, with some Resennnent, Ideclared to you,
