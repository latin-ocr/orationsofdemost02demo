AESCHINEs. 177

Now behold, said he, how succinffly Ι shall lay before you all
other Circumstances of this Affair. Does Philip appear to

AEschines a Man of extraordinary Memory, and powerfully elo-
quent? To me far otherwise. For, iu my Opinion, if any
one should take away from him his present Fortune, and give
it to another, that Person would not be greatly his Inferior.
Did he appear to Ctesiphon to have a certain Splendour in his

Aspeci? To me the Comedian Aristodemus, who was one of
our Ambaffador8‚ had not less Dignity. Was he formidable

in drinking largely? Our Colleague Philocrates much more
formidable. Did one of your Orators inform you, that he left
it to me to speak upon the Affair of Amphipolis? Yet never
would that Orator give either to you, or me an opportunity

of speaking. But these Circumstances are Trifles. Ι will move
for a Decree to negotiare a Truce with the Herald and Arn-

baffadorS, whom Philip {hall send hither3 to order the proper
MagistrateS, when they arrive‚ to appoint Assemblies during
two DayS, not only to treat of Peace‚ but an Alliance, offenfive
and defenfive3 to pronounce the customary Panegyric upon
our Ambaffadors‚ aud invite thern the Day following to a
public Entertainrnent, if they appear worthy of such Honours.
To convince you of the Truth of these AffertionS, Secretary,
take his Decrees, that you may perceive the W aywardness and
Malignity of the Man; his joining with Philocrates in all his
Schemes; and his own infidious and faithless Mauners. T lien

call our Colleagues, and read their Testimony.
