DEMOSTHENES. 151

powerful? These Misfort11ne8‚ however numerous and impor-

tant, were not occafioned by your Generals, but these Places
were ceded during the Peace, and Philip holds Poffession of
them by the Influence and Persuafion of these Traitors. They
vvere lost by them, and their Corruption.

IF these are the proper Objec'ts of his Defence‚ and he shall
wander from them, and choose rather to speak to every other
Qestion, be sure to make him this Reply. We do not now
fit in Judgement upon any of our Generals‚ nor are you accus-
ed of any Errors in the Conduct of the War. Do not therefore
tell us, that others are Accomplices with you in the Destruc-

tion of the Phocaeam, but convince us, that you yourself are

· innocent. What? Do you now affert, that Demosthenes is

guilty, yet never accusedshim when he paffed his Accounts?
Have you not always, even to this Moment‚ praised his Conduet? ,

Neither declaim upon the general Excellence and Advantages
of Peaee, because you are not accused of having influenced the

- Republic to conclude the Peace 3 but, that we were not {hame-

fully and opprobrioussy deceived in a thousand Instances after-
wardS‚ and our Affairs totally rui'ned, make these the Subjeets
of your Declamation. For it is represented to us, that you aret
the Author of all these Mischiefs, and are therefore justly dcem-
ed worthy of Destruction. If you are caresul to anssver him in
this Mamer, he will have nothing to reply‚ but {hall raise his
voice, and chaunt forth its Sweetness in vain.

PERHAPS:
