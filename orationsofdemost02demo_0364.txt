352 ORATION OF AESCI-IINES

BUT of more Importance the Confideration‚ if our Youth
should ask upon what Model they {hall form their future Lives,
what will you answer? You are conscious‚ that neither the
Places appointed for their Exercises, nor the Schools, nor their
Music, are sufficient to form them to Virtue, but far more ef-
ficacious our public Proclamations. Is a Man proclaimed in
the Theatre to be crowned for his Integrity‚ his Courage, and
Love of his Country‚ who is infamous for the Turpitude and

[mpurity of his Life ? Our Youth are instantly corrupted in
their Principles. Is an impious and a prostituted Wretch‚ like

Ctesiphon, punished‚ as he deserves? Others are instruited.
Is a Father‚ who hath paffed a Decree in Oppofition to every

Sentiment of Honour and Justice‚ capable, xyhen he returns
home, of forming his Son to Virtue? His Son will undoubted-
ly pay him little Attention, and his Advice at such a Time will
justly be called tedious and imper-tinent. Not therefore as
Judges only, but as Magistrates afflng in View of their Coun-
try‚ you should give Judgement in such a Manner as will justify
you to your absent Fellow-Citizens, when they shall demand
what Sentence you have pronounced. For be well affured,
Afflenians, that the ,ἱ Republic will always be thought to bear

some Resemblance to the Person we crown. Will it not be
therefore infamous in you to resemble the Cowardice of this

Demosthenes ; not the Magnanimity of your Ancestors?

Bur how lhall you escape such Infamy? Keepastrong
