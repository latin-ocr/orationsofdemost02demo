292 ORATION OF AESCHINES

mour and Tumult arose among the Amphictyons, who no lon- Ι
ger debated upon the Shields, we had consecrated, buton the
Punilhment to be inflieted on the Amphiffaeans. When great
Part of the Day was already elapsed, the Herald carne forth,
and proclaimed‚ that every Delphian, both Slave and Freeman‚
who had attained the Age of twenty Years, (18) should affem-
hle at first Appearance of Day with Mattocks and Spades at a
Place called by the Inhabitants the Place of Sacrifice. Again
the Herald proclaimed, that the sacred Registers and the De-
puties should affemble at the same Place to vindicate the God,
and affert the consecrated Glebe 3 and that whatever City did
not appear by its Deputies‚ should be driven from the Temple,

and deemed accursed and devoted to divine Vengeance.

EARLY next Morning we went to the Place appointed 3 des·-
cended to the Cyrrhaean Plain, and, having? rased the Harbour,
and burned the Houses‚ we retired. But while we were thus
employed, the Amphiffaean Locrians, who lived about seven
Miles from Delphos, all in Arms, rushed out upon us, and had
we not by a precipitato Flight, though with utmost Difficulty,

escaped into Delpth we had been in extreme Danger of being

destroyed.
