those, who were conscious of the Purity of his Manners. But

Aristophanes, an Olynthian, generally refided here in Athens.
He was recommended by some certain Persons to Demosthenes,
who was informed befides, that he was a very powerful Orator,

and who therefore endeavoured by every poffible Art to engage
himin his InterestS, and induce him to give a perjured Evi-

dence against me. He promised, if he would form some mise-
rable Story, and affure yOU, that in a drunken Riot 1 had

insulted a Woman, who was his Relation, and a Captive‚ he
would instantly give him five hundred DrachmaS, and five
>hundred others, when he had given Evidencc of the Fact. A·
ristophanesanswered‚ as he himself affured us, that with regard
to his Banishment and his Poverty, Demosthenes had not er-
roneoussy, but rather with all poflible Sagacity aimed his Con-
je&ures; but that he errcd extremely in his Opinion of his
Morals, for he never would commit so infamous an Action. In
Proof of what I have afferted, I shall produce Aristophanes
himself, as a Witness. Let him be summoned 3 'let his Testimony
be read3 then summon Dercyllus and Aristides, who heard him

tell this Story, and informed me of it.
