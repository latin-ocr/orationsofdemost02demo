IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 3643

dant Qantity of Words in Reflexions most impertinent to his

Cause‚ and hath multiplied his Falsehoods against me, 1 hold
it- neceffary and fitting, O Men of Athens, briefly to answer‚
first, to his CalumnieS, that none of you may be influenced by

Arguments thus totally foreign to the Subjec‘t, and hear me from
thence with Prejudice or Abhorrenoe, when I make my just
Defence against this Prosecution. To those Inveffives there-
fore, with which he hath maligned my private Reputation, be-
hold, how fimple and ingenuous is my Answer. If you are
conscious, that I am indeed such a Man, as he hath calumni-
oussy represented me (nor have I ever lived any where, but a-
mong you alone) do not suffer me to speak ; and however un-

blameable, or even meritorious, my whole Administration may
poffibly have been, this Moment rise from the Tribunal, and
pronounce my Sentence. But if you believe and are convinced,

that Ι am a Man of better Mora13‚ than my Accuser3 that Ι
am descended from a more reputable Family3 from Ancestors
(that I may avoid saying any thing offensive) not inferior to any
of those, who maintain the second Rank of Birth among our
Citizens, let him not find Credit with you in any other In-
st-ance 3 for it is manifest, that all other Instances are equally
the Produce of his Invention.x Then continue to me in the

present Contest that Favour and Benevolence‚ which in many

former Trials I have constantly experienccd.

FAMED as you are, AEschineS, for Malignity and Subtlety,
A a a 2 - you
