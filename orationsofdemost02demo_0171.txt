¹AES'CHINES. 159

I THEREFORE honour, and with singular Affecstion love you
for giving Credit rather to the Lives of the accused, than ¹to
the Accusations of their Enemies, yet Iwould not decline
making my Defence against this Charge3 because if any of our
CitizenS, who now surround this Court in Multitudes 3 if any of
rny Judges could believe Ι had committed such an Outrage,
not upon a free-born Woman only, but upon any other, Ι
should think the Remainder of my Life, a Life of Misery: and
if, in the Progress of my Apology, I do not clearly prove,
that the Accusation itself is false, and that he, who asserted it,
is an unhallowed Calumniator, I will acknowledge myself
worthy of Death‚ although 1 should not appear guilty of any
other Crime.

ΒΗΤ his Declamation 'appeared to me most unaccountable,

and cruelly unjust, when he asked you, whether it were pos-
fible, that, in the very same City, Philocrates should be con-
demned to die, because, in the Consciousness of his Crimes, he
would not venture to stand his Trial‚ and that I should be acquit-
ted. But I imagine, I ought in Justice, according to this very
reaspning, to be acquitted 3 for if he, who is conscious of his

CrimeS‚ and does not appear, be deemed guilty, certainly the

Man, who is conscious of his Innocence, and delivers up his
Person to the Laws, and his Fellow-Citizens, cannot be guilty.
