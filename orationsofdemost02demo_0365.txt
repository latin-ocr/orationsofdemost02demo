AGAINST CTESIPHON. 353

Guard upon those, who assume to themselves the Style os pub-
lic Virtue and Philanffiropy, yet in their private Chara&ers
are dishonest and perfidious. For Love of our Country and of

Liberty, are Expreffions, that lie open in common to every
Body, andin general, they, who take Poffeffion of the words,

are farthest distant from them in their Actions. When you
therefore find an Orator ardently defirous os Crovvns and Pro-
clamations in the general Affemblies os Greece‚ command him
to bring back his vague Oration, and his Affertions (as the Law
directs) to the Proofs of a Life worthy of Praise, and of un·
blemished MoraIS. If he cannot give you such Testimony, do
not ratify the PraiseS, with which he is proclaimed ; and thus
be caresul to preserve what yet remains of your Authority.
“But does it not appear to you most terrible, that the Senate
and People are treated with Contempt; that Dispatches and
Embasfies come to private Houses, not from Persons of inferior
Rank, but from the greatest Potentates of Europe and Afia?
The very Crimes our Laws make punishable with Death, a
certain Party do not deny their having committed, but profess
them in Presence of the People, and read their Dispatches to
each other. 'Some of them defire you to look up to them, as
to the Guardians of your Democracy ; others demand Rewards,
as Preservers of the Republic3 while the People, from very

Dejefflon of Spirit by their Misfortunes, as if they were grown
aged and doting in their Undmstanding, affume to themselves

the Name alone of a popular Goverment‚ but have yielded the
