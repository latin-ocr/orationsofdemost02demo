252 ORATION OF AESCHINES

“ upon their Magistracy‚ when they have been approved of by

‘⁶ a legal Examination into their Lives and Manners.’' ¹ If we
therefore take away from this N umber, those who are appointed
by Elestion, and by Lot, it then remainS„ that they, whom
either a whole T sibe, or a third of it, or the Boroughs of At-
tica choosc out of their own Body to expcnd the public Money‚
must be acknowledged MagistrateS, duly elected, This hap-
penS, whenever‚ as in the present Instance, any public Work
is decreed to the Tribe8‚ whether to compleat> your Intrench-
mentS‚ or build your Gallies. ThatI affert *the Truth‚ you
shall be informed by the Laws themselveS.

The LAws.

i Yon remember what I have already urged, that the Legissa-
tor commands those, who have been elected by their Tribes, to
enter upon their Magistracy, when they have paffed the judicial
Examination with Regard to their Reputation. 1 But the Pan—
dionian Tribe declarcd Demosthenes a Magistrate and Super·
intendant of our Walls, and he received, out of the Funds
affigned for repairing them, little less, than ten Talents. ⁶{et
another Law expressly forbids any Magistrate‚ who hath not

given in his Accounts, to be crowned: ἱ Youfflve sworn to

pronounce Sentence according to the Laws: Ctesiphon hath
proposed to crown a Man yet accountable, and even without

adding, “ after he shall have given in, and proved his Ac-

counts.'’!
