Domo our Embaffy Demosthenes was very solicitous to be
received into our Mess, nor was he admitted by me, but by my
Companions, Iatrocles and Aglaocreon, the Tenediam, whom

that 1 preffed him, while we were traveling‚ with the N ecessity
of our mutually guarding against that Monster Philocrates.
This Story is a most improbable Fiction. For how could I

have urged Demosthenes to be cautious of Philocrates, when Ι
was conscious he had been his Advocate in the Prosecution

against him for enafflng new Laws in Oppofition to those al-
ready established3 and had been nominated by him to this
Embaffy. Befides, we, who were his Colleagues, were not
engaged with him in Discourses of this Kind, but were compel-
led, through our whole Journey, to suffer his imprafflcable,
gloomy Temper. While we wereconsulting, what Arguments
we should use, and Cyrnon declared he was apprehenfive, that
Philip would prove too powerful for us in pleading his own
-Cause, Demosthenes promised us such copious Fountains of
Eloquence, and affured us, he had such things to urge with

regard to the Justice of our Claim to Amphipolis, and the Be-

ginning of the War, as would stitch up Philip's Mouth with a
dry Reed 3 (10) persuade the Republic to recall Leosthenes from
