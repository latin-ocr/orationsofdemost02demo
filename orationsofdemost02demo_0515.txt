IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 503

be delivered up to their Resentment3 when I was summoned
to appear before the Ampliietyons3 when Menaces and Pro-
mises were equally employed to terrify or seduce me from my
Duty3 when these Wretches were let loose, like wild Beasts, to
destroy me, yet I never abandoned my Zeal for your Interests.

lFrom my first Entrance into Ministry, Ι chose the dire& and
honest Path3 to dedicate my Ser-vices to the Honours‚ the

Glory of my Country, and in them to fix my own Being.l

Upon any Succeffes of a certain Nation I‘never wander round
the Forum with a Countenance of Exultation and Triumph,

stretching forth my Hand in Sign of Gratulation, and pub-
lishing the joyful Tidings to People, who, I am confident,
will send Advice of my Behaviour elsewhere. Nor do I hear
the Sueceffes of the Republic with Horror, and Groans; or
bend me to the Earth in Sorrow, like these impious Wretches‚
who ssanderoussy abuse the Commonwealth‚ as if they could
ssander Her without publishing their own Infamy. All their
Views are dimeted to a foreign Power, and when he harh
founded his Dominion upon the Calamities of Greece, they
make it the Subjeffit of their Encomiums, and boldly tells us,
it is our Duty to render it for ever fixed and permanent. But
never, O all ye Gods ! never may any of your Divinities con-

firm their impious Wishes. Inspire them rather, with better

Counsels and Affeetions. But if they continue thus incurable,

separate them wholly from this People3 pursue them, both by
Land
