43¹0 DEMOSTHENES

Citizens of other RepubliCS‚ instrueked for the Purpose, instantss
ly proposed Philip at the next Affembly to be Commander in

Chief, and alledged many very plausible Reasons in F avour of

their Proposal ; ‘⁶ That either they must be obliged to bring in
“ Contributions themselveffi to maintain a Body of foreign
“ Troops, and to punish those, who refused to comply with
“ their Orders, or to ele& Philip their General.'' What
need I say more? Upon these Reasons he was ele&ed; when
instantly affembling his Forces‚ and entering on a feigned
March to Cyri-ha, he heartily bids fai-ewell to the Cyrrhaeans
and Locrians, and seizes upon Elataea. At this Moment there-
fore, if the Thebans had not suddenly changed their Resolution,
and united with yon, this whole Projee't, like a Winter's Tem-
pest, had precipitately fallen on the Republic. Thus, prin-
cipally, by the favourable Interpofition of some God, O Men

of Athens, and next, as far as lies within the Power of any one
Man, by my Services‚ did the Thebans instautly check the
Progress of this Destroyer„ Now let the Secretary read the se-
veral Resolutions of the Congress at Thermopylae, with their
respefflve Dates‚ that you may behold what Mischiefs this de-
testable Villain occafioned, for which he hath to this Moment
escaped your Vengeance. Read.
