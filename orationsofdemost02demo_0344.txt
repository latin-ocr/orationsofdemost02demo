332 ORATION OF AESCHINES

ed from his Office by passing his AccountS. I then conviciet}
him of having decreed a Crown to Dernosthene8‚ who was yet
accountable for his Employment, and even without giving any
specious Praetext for his Decree, or inserting the usual Form„
“ if he have paffed his Accounts‚” but acting through the
whole Affair with an absolute Contempt both of you, and the ’
Laws„ Ι mentioned the Objecstions he would probably make,
and which Ι think well deserve to be remembered. I then-r
ran over your Proclamation—Laws‚ in which it is pofitively de-
clared, that the Person, whom the People have honoured with
a Crown, shall not be proclaimed except in their own Affem-
blies. Yet Ctesiphon hath not only violated the Laws them-
selves, but every Circumstance of Time and Place with Regard
to the Proclamation, when he commands it to be made in the
T heatre‚ not in your Affembly3 not when the People are
affimbling, but when the Tragedians are entering upon the
Stage. I afterwards made some few Remarks upon his private?

Character, and infisted more largely upon his public Crime&

You ssiould therefore in Justice oblige Demosthenes to make
his Defence in the same Order3 first, with Regard to the Law,

that obliges Magistrates to pass their Accounts of Office 3 next,
the Law, that regulares our Proclamation33 and lastly, which
is the capital Article, let him disprove his being unworthy of
any Rcwards If he should intreat you to comply with his own

Arrangeriielit of his Oration, and promise at the End of his
Apology
