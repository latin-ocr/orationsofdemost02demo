IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 381

Counsels. Otherwise, nothing could be happier, than the Condi·
tion of these Traitors 3 but this, certainly this, is not thcir

Condition. *For whoever aims at arbitrary Power, and is suc-
cessful in his Ambition, instantly becomes the Tyrant of those,
who have given him his Authority, and by his own Experience
conscious of their Wickedness‚ he then, certainly then, detests,
distrusts, despises. But consider the Circumstances of this Af-
fair3 for although the Time, in which it happened, be really
passed, yet the Time of knowing it with Certainty is always
present to the Wise. How long was Lasthenes called the
F-riend of Philip Ρ. untill he had betrayed Olynthus. How long
was Timolaus? untill he had destroyed the Thebans· How
long Eudemus and Simus? untill they had reduced Theffaly
under the Power of Philip. Then driven into Exile, and treated

with Ignominy, what Indignities did they not suffer? The
whole world is full of those Traitors. Aristratus at Sicyon?

Perilaus at Megara? are they not most abjeci: and despised?
From these Instances it is easy to perceive, that whoever most
zealoussy defends his Country‚ and forms the most powerful
Oppofition to such Villainies‚ gives to you, AEschinCS, to these
Traitors and Mercenaries, an Opportunity of receiving the VVages
of Corruption3 and when the Number is confiderable, and
the Opposition to your pernicious Counsels supported with Ar-
dour‚ you then continue in perfect Security, and enjoy your
Penfions; for left to yourselves, you had been long since totally

undone.
