baffadors suffered it. First read the Testimony 3 then the De-

TESTIMONY. DECREE.

Here are no Praises, no Invitation from the Senate to the Am-
baffador83 or if AEschines afferts the contrary, let him prove,

let· him make them appear. But it is impossible.

INDEED, if we had all adsted in the same Manner, most
justly had the Senate refused its Praises to us all 3 for undeniably

our Condud‘c in general was greatly criminal. But if some of us*
preserved, while others betrayed, their Integrity‚ it is apparent,
that the Innocent have been obliged to participate of one com—
mon Infamy with the Guilty. v ‘⁶ But how shall you all with-
“ out Difficulty distinguish, who is guilty ?” Remember, who
blamed the Conduet of these Ambaffadors upon the Instant
they returned. For it is manifest, that a Man, who was con-
scious of his own Guist, would have been contented with being
silent3 and if he could have eluded an immediate Inquiry,

would never afterwards render an Account of his ConduCt.
But to the Man, who is conscious of his Innocence, it is most

afflkstiug to be filent, when his Silence exposes him to the Sus-
picion of being a Partner in the Crimes and Guilt of others,
But I stood forth the Accuser of these Ambaffadors, when
they returned from their Embaffy, nor have ever by any of
them been accused.
