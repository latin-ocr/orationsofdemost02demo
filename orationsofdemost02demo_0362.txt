350 ORATION oF AESCHINES

Bur their Want of common Sense is worthy of your Confi<
deration. For if Ctesiphon shall dare to call Demosthenes to

his Affistance 3 if he should come forward and pronounce his

own Encomium, the very listening to him will be more into—
ι lerable‚ than all the Calamities you have suffered by his Mi-

nistry. Because, if we can ill endure even persons of real Me- >

rit, of whose great and glorious Affions we are perfeffly

conscious, when they proclaim their own Praises, who can
have Fortitude enough to hear a Man, the Dishonour and
Reproach of the Commonwealth, if he should pronounce his

own Panegyric? You will therefore, Ctesiphon, if you are
wife, defist from such an impudent Experiment, and make your
own Defence. You cannot excuse yourself by any pretended
Want of lzloquence ; for it were absurd indeed, that you, who
formerly suffered yourself to be ele&ed Ambaffador to Cleopa-
tra, the Daughter of Philip, to condole with her upon the
Death of her Husband Alexander, should now declare you are
not a very able Orator. (42) Were you capable of consoling

a foreign Qeen in her Sorrows, and are you unable to justify a
Decree, which you have been bribed to prefer?

BUT the Person, to whom you have decreed this Crown,

is he really so unknown to the People of Athens, who have been
thus

(42) Alexander, King of Epirus, had Upon this unhappy Occafion, the Re-
carried the War into Italy3 his Army public sent Ctesiphon with Compliments
was routed; he himself killed, and his of Condolence to his Qeen.

Body treated with a thousand Indignities.
