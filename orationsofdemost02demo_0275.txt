Coward, He threatens to lay me open to public View3 to drag

me to the Tribunal, and compel me to answer. That he may
not therefore triumph in his Strength3 that you may be previ-

Pleasure of the Gods; if our Judges hear us impartially, and
Ι can recollcet the Crimes, Iam conseious you have committed,
Ι am wholly confident, I shall convince our Jutlges‚ that the
immortal Gods, and the Magistrates, who dii-ened your Affairs
with a milder Spirit, and· more temperately, were the Preservers
