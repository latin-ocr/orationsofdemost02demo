IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. ξεῖ

Generals, Eubulus the Cytherian‚ delivered his Cpr-:i .;
Whereas the Generals have made Report to the Assembiy, thau:
Philip's Admiral Amyntas hath carried into Macedonia, and
there detains in Custody, our Admiral Laodamas, with twenty
Veffels sent to the Hellespont for the Importation of Corn3 be
it decreed, that the Prefidents of the Senate, and the Generals
take Care to convene the Senate, and that Ambaffadors be sent
to Philip, who shall remonstrate to him upon his releafing
the Admiral, the Veffels and the Soldiers25 that if Amyntas
hath indeed acted in this Matter through Ignorance, the Athe—
nian People will not prefer any Complaint against him 3 or if κ

Laodamas [hall be found to have aeted in any Thing contrary
to his Instruffions, the Athenian People will take Cognizance

of the Affair‚ and punish him according to the Nature of his
Offence: but if neither of these appear to be the real State of
the case, but that some intentioned Injustice hath been com·
mitted either by Philip or his Admiral 3 then the Ambafladors

shall return an Account of the Affair, that the People may de-
liberate upon proper Measures. Eubulus therefore, not De·-

mosthenes, preferred this Decree3 Aristophon another; after-
wards Hegefippus3 Aristophon a second Time3 then Philocra-

tes, Cephisophon‚ and many others. Ι never had any Cone
cernment in these Measures. Read the Decree.
