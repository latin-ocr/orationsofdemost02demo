384 DEMOSTHENES

Demosthenes is at this Moment Surveyor of our Walls, and
Direffimr of our theatrical Funds: that the Crown should not

be proclaimed in the Theatre, during the Festival of Bacchus,
when the new Tragedians are entering upon the Stage ε that if
the Senate deerees a Crown, it {hall be proclaimed in the Se-

nate-House 3 if the People, in their own Affemffly, in the
Citadel. This Indidment is marked at fifty Talents. The

Witneffes Cephisophon and Cleon.

THESE, O Men of Athens, are the Articles, to which AEs-
chines hath objeffi’ted. But even from these Articles themselves,

I principally hope the Justice of my future Defence will appear.
I shall follow the same Method he has pursued in his Indi&-

ment, and speak to them separately and in order, nor shall de-
fignedly leave any of them unmentioned. When Ctefiphon

therefore affirms, that in all my Words and Afflons, I con-
stantly supported the Interests of the People3 that I was always
ready with the utmost Alacrity to render them every Service,
to the utmost of my Abilities 3 and that upon these Accounts
I am worthy of being praised, I imagine, the Decifion of the
Qestion will depend upon my Conduec in Administration3
for when that hath been examined with Attention, it will be
found, whether he hath pronounced coneerning mge with T ruth'

and Candour, or with Partiality and F alsehood. {That he hath
not added, “he shall be crowned after having given in his

Accounts ;'' that he hath ordered, ‘⁶ the Crown ffiall be pro-
“ claimed
