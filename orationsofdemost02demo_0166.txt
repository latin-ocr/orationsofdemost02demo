{54 ORATIONS,&c.
destroy this fingle Traitor. For if they have aeted in. this Man-

ner under the Apprehenfion of being punished‚ what Crimes,
„do you imagine, will they not commit, when no longer appre-
henfive of your Vengeance? What Kind of Euthycrates?
What Kind of Lasthenes? What Betrayer will they not excell
in Villainy? Will not your citizens become the most abandon-
ed of all Mankind, when they behold the Wretches, who have
sold their Country‚ enjoying Riches‚ Authority‚ and Impunity,
by the Friendship of Philip, while they, who preserve their
Integrity‚ and spend their Fortunes in the Service of the Public,
are pursued with Vexations‚ Hatred, Envy? May this never
happen. Never can it promote your Glory, your Piety, your
Security‚ nor answer any other valuable Purpose‚ to aequit this
Traitor; but to render him an Example of your Justice‚ both
to your own Citizens‚ and to all the other States of Greece, will

best promote the Interests of the Republic.
