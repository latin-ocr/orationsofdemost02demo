cording to those Laws Ρ Yet after having acted in this Man-
ner, you enumerate the Qalifications, that should necessarily
enter into the Character of a zealous and faithful Republican,
as if you were giving Direetions to a Sculpt0r‚ and had after-
wards received a Statue greatly different from the Diree'cions
you had given3 or as if a valuable Republican were to be de-
scribed by your Words, not by his own Conducst, and the
Measures he had proposed in his Ministry. (18) Then with
Clamour and Vociferation, as if you were still in the original
Cart of your Profeffion, (19) you utter a Language, without

Distinfflon of fitting or unfitting‚ far better suited to thee, and thy

Family, than mine. However, I conceive there is this Differ—⁷

cnce, O Men of Athens, between lnvefflves and a legal Prose-

cution‚ that Prosecutions have for their Objects some Crimes,

sor which the Laws denounce a proper Punilhment3 but ln-

(18) Our Author laughs at AEschines
for suppoling. that a Minister of State
could be exactly formed according to his
Description. He makes no Allowance
for the various Abilities and virtues and
Paffions, that must enter into the Com-
pofition ·‚ and form perhaps the rnost
complex Being of the creation. He ex-
pec‘ts it should he complete and fimple,
as it appears in his Ideas. Thus he givcs
Dirc& ons to a Sculptor for a Statue, but
will be miserably disappointed, if he
imagines, he shall see it finished in every
Feriam, Lineainent, and Attitude‚ ac-
cording to those Direc‘tions.

'she learned Rcader will find the latter

Part of the Sentence rendered very differ-
ently from the Sense‚ in which it is under-
stood by our Transsators‚ and Commen-
tators.

(19) ὥσπερ ἐξ οἷμοῖξης. As if out
of a Cart. The Transsator conferres, he
has no Authority among our Commen-
tators sor applying these Words to the
particular Cart, in which Thespis and
his first ssrolli g Comedians exhibited
their Plays. Yet this Application gives
a peculiar Spirit to the l'affage, as it
whimfically represents AEschines in this
original Theatre of his Profesfion.v which

- Demosthenes is always extremely careful

to remember.
