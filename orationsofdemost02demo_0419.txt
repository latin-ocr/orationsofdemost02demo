IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 407

Fellow—CitizenS. Now read the Decree‚ for which Iwas in-

dieted. Then read the Schedule of Taxes appointed by our
former Laws, and afterwards by mine.

THE DECREE.

UNDER the Archonship of Polycles, on the fixteenth of Sep-
tember, Demosthenes proposed a Law to the Board of Admiral-
ty, repealing all former Laws, by which the Contributions of
the Trierarchs were regulated. It was confirmed by the Senate

and People. Patrocles preferred an Indie'tment against De-

mosthenes for this Violation of our Laws, and not gaininga
fifth Part of the Suffrages, was fined five hundred Drachmas.

Now produce the very honest Taxes of our former Laws.

THE TAxEs.

LET sixteen Trierarchs, from twenty five Years of Age to for-
ty‚ be appointed for building one Galley, and let thern equally
contribute to the Expence.

Now read the Taxes proposed by my Law.

The TAxEs.
&LE-[- the Trierarchs be chosen, according to the ValuatiOn of

their Estates. If it amount to ten· Talents, let them build one
Galley3 if to more than ten Talents, let them be taxed in pro-
portion as far as building three Gallies and a F rigate 3 if to less,
then let a Number be joined together, whose Estates amount·

to that Sum. r
