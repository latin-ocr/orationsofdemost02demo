AGAINST CTESIPHON. ὴ 351

thus indebted to his Merit, that he must plead this Cause
himself. Let us ass< the JudgeS, whether they know Chabrias,

Iphicrates and Timotheus3 or wherefore they gave them such
honorary Rewards, and ereeted Statues to them. They will

unanimoussy answer, to Chabrias, for his naval Victory at
Naxos 3 to Iphicrates, for having cut to pieces the Lacedaemo-
nian Phalanx3 to Timotheus, for his Expedition to Corcyr33

to others, for their many great and glorious Services performed
in War. If it ssiould be asked, why then refuse this Honour

to Demosthenes? Because he is corrupt, a Coward, a Descr-
ter of his Post in Battle. Whether will you therefore honour
Him, or dishonour yourselves and them, who gallantly lost
their Lives in your Defence ? Imagine you behold thern, with
every Expreffion of Misery and Indignation, lamenting his
being crowned 3 for if we carry, beyond the Limits of Attica,
either Timber or Stones, or Pieces of Iron, things senfeless and
inanimate, that have accidentally fallen and killed an human
Creature; or if, when a Citizen hath been guilty of Self-Mur-
¹ der, we bury the Hand, that committed the Deed, separately
from the Body3 it will be terrible indeed, thaffDemosthenes,
O AthenianS, the Man, who decreed this last unfortunate Ex—
pedition ; who betrayed the Army by his Cowardice, shall- be*
honoured and rewarded. The Dead will be insulted', and ther
Living discouraged‚ when they behold, that Death is placed
before them as the only Reward of their Virtute, and that even
their Virtue shall itself be 10st to Remembrance.
