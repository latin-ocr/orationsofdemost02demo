164 ORATloNOF

while Demosthenes never offered any Oppofition, but on the
contrary, preferred a Decree to crown Aristodemus.

WHILE these Declarations were made in your Affembly,
Philocrates proposed a Decree, to {end ten Ambaffadors to Philip,
who might enter into a Negotiation upon the Peace, and some
other Articles of mutual Advantage to both Parties. When
these Ambaffadors were appointed, I was proposed by Nauficles,
and DemostlieneS‚ who now accuses PhilocrateS, was however
nominated by Philocrates· So earnest was he in the Affair,
that he moved the Senate to indemnify Aristodemus, and send
him as a Colleague of the Embaffy, and to appoint other Am-

baffadors to the Cities, in which he had engaged to aet, who
should solicit an Alleviation of his Fine. (9) In Proof of these

Affertions, take the Decrees, and read the Testimony of Aris-

todemus, taken when he was abroad, and then call the Persons‚
who witnefl‘ed it, that the Judges may know, who was the

Friend of Philocrates, and who promised to persuade the People

to give Aristodemus Presents of Indemnification.

The DECREES. The TESTmons.

Such was the Beginning of this whole Affair, not directed by

me, but by Demosthenes and Philocrates.
