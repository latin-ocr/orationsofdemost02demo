AGAINST CTESIPHON. 253

THUS have 1 clearly proved the Illegality of this Decree, and
at once produced the Law3‚ your own Demoes, and even my

Adversaries as my Witneffes. How can any Man more clearly
demonstrate, that another hath preferred Decrees most ldireffly
contrary to Law? But I {hall now convince you, that {he Procla-

mation of this Crown is absolutely illegal. For the Law
expressly command8‚ “ if theSenate decrees a Crown, it shall be
“ proclaimed in the Senate-House3 if the People, in their own
“ Assembly. Never in any other Place.'‘ l Read the Law.

The LAW.

TH1s Law, Athenian8‚ is really excellent. For, in my

Judgement‚ the Legissator did not imagine it neoeffary, that
an Orator should make himself honoured by Strangers‚ but
content himself with being esteemed in his own Republic by

the People, and not make a Trade of publishing these Pro—
clamations. (4) Thus the Legissator 3 but Ctesiphon, how does

he a& ? Read his Decree.

The DECREE.

You hear, Athenians, that the Author of the 'Law com-
mands, whoever is crowned by a Decree of the People, shall

be proclaimed in their own Affembly, nor in any other Place.
But
