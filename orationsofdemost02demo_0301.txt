appointed Midias (who, for many Reasons, Iwish were still alive)
Thrasycles‚ and me, your Deputies to the Ainphidlyonie Council.
It happened, a little Time after our Arrival at Delphos, that
Diognetus fell fick of a Fever, and that Midias was seized with
the same Distemper. The other Amphietyons however afferu-
bled, when we were informed, by Persons willing to ffiew their
Affection for this Republic, that the AmphiffieanS, fallen at
that Time under the Power of the Thebans, and held in Vas-

had performed the usual Ceremonies of consecration, and en-
graving upon them this very proper Inscription. TAKEN ΒΥ Tne
