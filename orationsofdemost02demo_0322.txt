ORATION OF AESCHINES

Sacrifices to the Manes of Pausanias, (24) and fixed upon the
Senate the Crime of celebrating the joyful News of Philip’s
Death by a public Festival. He then contemptuoussy gave
Alexander the Surname of Driveler‚ and confidently afferted, he

would never stir out of Macedonia, but hold himself extremely
contented in walking round his Capital, and inspeefing the En-
trails of his Viffims. (2 5) These Affertions, he affured us,
were founded, not upon finiple Conjeelures, but upon his own
clear and perse& Science, that Glory is only to be purchased by

Blood. ( 26) Thus reasoned the Man, who hath not himself a Drop

of Blood in his Veins; who forms his Judgement of Alexander,
not upon the Genius of Alexander, but upon his own Cowardice.

For Instance‚ when the Theffalians resolved to invade the Re-
public, and the young Monarch in the first Transports of his
Anger, nor unreasonable his Anger, had invested Thebes, De-
mosthenes being appointed your Ambaffador to intercede for the
besieged, betook himself to Flight from the very Midd-le of

Mount

killed Philip for an inhumari Outrage
offered him by one of his Favourites,
and which the Monarch negle&ed to pu-
nish.

the Macedonian Monarchs not only to
inspefil, but even to handle the Entrails
of their Viffims.

if literally transsated is, perhaps, hardly
intelligible. Virtue or Valzm· is only to be
purchased by Blonz' ; or as Lambinus ren-
ders it, virlutem non m'st ste-nguine compa-

the Reputasion of Virtue or Valour, the
sentiment is just and of great Dignity.
