AGAINST cTESIPHoN. 255

Account itself demonstrates. Givc me therefore such equirable
hearing, and is any of you come hither long fince prepossefl'ed
with an Opinion, that Demosthenes never pleaded, in Collufion
with Philocrates, in Favour of ' Philip; if any of you be thus
persuaded, let him neither aequit, nor condemn, before he
hears the Proofsl‘, he will otherwise be most unjust. But if
you give me your Attention, while I briefly recollect these Pc-
riods; while I produce thc Decree, that Demosthenes and
Philocrates preferred3 if the very Calculation of Truth itself
shall convici: Demosthenes of having with Philocrates proposed

‘more than one Decree in Favour of that former Peace and Al-
liance 3 of having even to a ssiameless Excess of Adulation
flattered Philip, and his Ambaffadors, nor waited for‘thc Re-
turn of the Embassies you had sent to animate the Grecians to
engage in a Consederacy against him3 of being the sole Cause,
that the People of Athens ratified a separate Peace with Philip,
without the Concurrence of the general Council of Greece; of
having rendered Chersobleptes, King of Thrace, a Consederate
and Ally to this Republic, a Tributary to Philip 3 is Ι mani-
festly demonstrate all these Articles, I (hall implore you to grant

me one very reasonable Request. Acknowledge, in the N ame

’ ,“ of the immortal Gods, that he bath-acted neither honour-ably,

nor advantageoussy for the Republic, during this first Period.

⁷ Ι shall begin from whence you may follow me with greatest Ease

and Certainty.
