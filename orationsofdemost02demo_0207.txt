AEscH'INES. 195

Embafsy, who had been chosen at first, Iesteemed it my Duty
not to prevaricate with the Athenian People. You did not
afterwards accuse me with regard to this Embaffy, when I
made my Report, but you now attack me upon the second, ap—
pointed for demanding Philip’s Oath, whichl can clearly and
justly defend. To you indeed it is most convenient, as to all
LiarS, to alter the Situation and Circumstances of Time, but
Ι shall regularly pursue my Discourse, beginning with our De-
parture on our second Embaffy. First then, among our ten
Ambaffadors, to whom another was added by our Confederates,
not one would ever eat with this Demosthenes, when we de—
parted for our second Embaffy3 nor upon the Road, where-
ever it was possible to avoid it, would they enter the same Inn,

because they perceived he had formed some villainous Defigns
against thern. But with regard to going into Thrace, there
was not the least Mention of it, for the Decree gave no Instruc-
tions about it, and only ordered us to receive Philip's Oath,
with some other particular Direciions. Nor indeed, if we had
gone, was it poffible to have rendered any Service to Chersoblep-

tes, as his Affairs were in such a Situation, as you have been

just now informed; nor has Demosthenes told you one Syllable
of Truth, but invents these Falsehoods, and having nothing

real whereof to accuse me, he utters these monstrous Calumnies.

BUT two Men followed him carrying a couple of Blankets,

in one of which, as he informed us, was a Talent of Silver.
