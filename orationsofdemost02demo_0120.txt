10'8' ORATIONSOF·

for the Safety of their Brother, sois it yours to defend the Laws,
the whole Republic, and especially to preserve the Oaths invio—
lable, which you took before you sat upon this Tribunal. But

is they solicit you to aequit this Man, consider whether they
make the Request upon a Presumption of his appearing innocent
or guilty? If innocent, I myself declare for his acquitta13 if
they desire it upon any other Terms, they defire you to perjure
yourselves. Because, although the Suffrage be given in secret,
it does not therefore escape the Knowledge of the Gods. For‘
the Legissa‘tor, in this, and all other Instances, most excellent,
hath pronounced·, “ the suffrages shall be given in secret.”

Wherefore? That the Crimina] may never know the Man,
to whom he is obliged. But the Gods, and the supreme Divi-2

nity will know the Man, who hath not pronounced an upright
Sentence3 and it is infinitely more eligible to expe& from thern
our own Happiness, and that of our Posterity, for giving
Judgement with Justice and Equity, than to fix a secret ancl
uncertain Obligation upon the Criminal, 01· to aequit this Man,
who harh himself given Evidence against himself. For what
more unexceptionable Witness‚ AEschines, that you have com-
mitted many flagrant Villainiesv in your Emvbafly, can Ῑ poffibly
produce, than you against yourself Ρ Even that severe and 'ex-
traordinary Punissiment, which you thought proper to inflict
upon him, who proposed to dete& your Crimes, openly declares
what Vengeance you yourself expect, if your Judges are informet}
of your Condue‘n
