The CoNVENTmN between Pium and the PHoeAEANs.

Do⁴ you hear, O Men of Athens? He sayS, “ the Con-
“ vention between Philip and the Phocaeans,'’ not between

the Thebans and Phocaeans3 the Theffalians and Phocaeans;

the Locrians or any other People. And again3 he says,
“ they must deliver up their Towns to Philip‚” not to the
Thebans, Theffalians, or any other People. Wherefore? Be-

cause AEschines had declared to you, that Philip had marched
into Thermopylae for the Preservation of the Phocaeans. They·

therefore placed their entire Confidence in him; they diree'ted
all their Views towards him; they concluded a Peace with him.

Let the Secretary read the Remainder. Then do you confidet
what they believed, and what they suffered. Have they any·

Likeness or Resemblance to the Promises of AEschines? Read.
