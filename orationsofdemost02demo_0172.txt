ubo ORATION OF

[ΕΤ me, however, implore you, that, during this whole
Prosecution, if Ishould omit or forget any Circumstances of
Importancc, you will ask and desire me to explain whatever·
you defire to know, and hear me with an impartial Attentiorz
and without Prejudice of my being guilty. Yet Ι am extremely
doubtful, from th· Irregularity of the Prosecution, from whence
1 should begin my Defence. It is yours to confidet, whether
my Doubts appear reasonable. I am now tried for a Crime,
that may affe& my Life, yet the greatest Part of the Prosecu- '

tion is employed in accufing Philocrates and Phrynon, and our
other Colleagues, and Philip, and the Peace, and the Adminis-

tration of Eubulus, but in every one of these 1 am included,
while Demosthenes alone, through his whole Oratim, ‘is anxioua
for the Republic, and all others are T raitors. Nor hath he—
ceased from insulting, and pouring forth his lying Invectives,
not against me only, but against the other Ambaffadors. Yet
while in general he treats me with Ignominy and Contempt‚
upon any sudden Alteration of his Opinion, from whatsoever
Cause it happen, asif he prosecuted an Alcibiades or a Themis-
tocles, who* exceeded all our other Grecians in Authority, (6)
he charges me with destroying the Cities of the Phocaeans, ali-
enating the whole Regionof Thrace, and expelling Chersobleptes,

an Ally and Confederate of the Republjc, from his. Kingdom.
