DEMOSTHENES. 135

SEVERAL of your Citizens have indeed, upon particular Oc-
cafions, gained an Influence over you 3 Calistratus, Aristophon,

DiophantUS, and others formerly. But where did they exert
this Influence? In your Affem'olies only: for never, even to

this Day, did any of them affurne an Authority in your Courts
of Justice: an Authority more powerful than you yourselves3
than the Laws and your Oaths. Do not therefore suffer Eubulus

to usurp this Authority. But to convince you, it will be a
greater Proof of your Wisdom to preserve it yourselves‚ than to

intrust it to otherS, I will read you the Oracles of the Gods,
who far more powerfully protect the Republic, than they, who
govern it. Read.

The ORACLES.

’ Do you hear, O Men of Athens, what the Gods declam?-
Ifin Time of War, therefore, they had made this Declaration,
they would have advised you to guard with Caution against'
your Commanders‚ because in War your Commanders are your
Governors3 if in Peace, to guard against your Magistrates 3
because they are then your Governors3 you obey them, and
are in, Danger of being deceived by thern. Befides, the Oracle
declares, that the Republic should be united 3 that her Citizens

should be unanimous in their Decifions, and not give Pleasure
to their Enemies, thther then do you imagine, O Men of
Athens,

The Reader is indebted for this Re· standing, to Doaor Taylor in his Notes
mark, certainly of much good Under· upon another Oration.
