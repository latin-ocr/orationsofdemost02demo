The ARGUMENT.

T was customary among the Athenians to reward the Merit of their

Citizens with Crowns of Olive, interwoven with Gold. Ctefiphon
had proposed a Decree in the Senate, that Demosthenes ffiould be crowned
in the Theatre for his distinguished Virtue, and eminent Serviees to the
Republic. AEschines prosecutes Ctesiphon for this Decree. He attempts
to prove it illegal in itselfi and in all its Circumstances. It ex-
poses those Honours to Contempt, which were originally defigned to
animate and reward the Virtue of their Citizens. It deceives the People,
whom it is highly criminal to deceive, when it proposes to crown De·-
mosthenes for his persona] Merit, or his public Services to the Common-
wealth. For Demosthenes is infamous in his private Charac’ter, and in.
his public Administration the Dishonour and Ruin of his Country.
