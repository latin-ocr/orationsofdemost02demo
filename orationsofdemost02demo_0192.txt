180 ORATION OF

Now read the Resolution of our Confederates, in which it N
is expreffly written, “ Since the People of Athens are now
“ deliberating upon a Peace with Philip3 since the Ambafi‘a-
‘²‘ dom, whom they sent into Greece to animate her Ciries to
‘⁶ defend their common Liberty, are not yet returned, it seem-
“ eth good to the confederates, that when the Ambaffadors
“ shall return, and make Report of their Embaffy to the
“ Athenians, the Magistrates should* appoint two Affemblies
‘⁶ according to Law. In them let the People of Athens con-

“ sult upon the Peace, and whatever they determine, let it be

“ the common Resolution of the Confederates.’' Read me ’

the Resolution of the Plenipotentiaries of our Consederates.

The RsssomeN.

READ me now the Decree preferred by Demosthenes, in

which he commands the Magistrates, after the Festival of
Bacchus, celebrated within the City, (15) and the customary

Affembly held in his Temple, to appoint two general Affem-
blies on the eighteenth and nineteenth3 thus precisely marking
the Time, and preffing forward the Affembly before the Return
of our Ambaffadors. Befides, the Resolution of our Consede-
rates, which Ι acknowledge I supported, only direets you to
deliberate upon a Peace with Philip, but Demosthenes urges you
to conclude a League offenfive and defenfive. Read his Decree

to the Judges.

His DECREE.
