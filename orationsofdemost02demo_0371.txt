‘D'EMOSTHENES

IN DEFENCE OF

CTESIP·HON.

IFrsssT implore, O Men of AthenS, all our Gods, and all
our Goddesses, that the same Measure of Affetstion for this?

Republic in general, and for every fingle Citizen among you,
which hath ever been the Guide of all my Αὲὶίοηε, may be

now present to me in this Contest. Next, as of exceeding Im-
portance to you, to the sacred Obligation of your Oaths, and
to your Glory‚ I do implore the same Deities to impress upon
your Minds a Resolution not to make my Prosecutor, your

Adviser,

The Solemnity, with which our Ora· have had upon an Athenian Audience,
tor opens his Defence, must have com· a Transsator can only lament the Loss

manded the Attention of his Audience,
and t'ne religious Confidence of his Prayer
to the Gods impreffed upon them a fa·
vourable Opinion of his Piety, that best
Affurance he could give of his Integrity.
The pathetic Prafeffions of bis Zeal for
the Republic in general, and for every
individual Citizen in particular, had a
Rig'nt of Chim to an equal Return of
their Affeffion. ’1 hese Sentiments a
Transsation may poffibly be able to ex-
press3 but when the Ancients talk to us
with Rapture of a peculiar Harmony in
the Words and Measures of the Origi-
nal‚ and the Influence it must necess'arily

of so exquisite a Pleasure: a Loss, per-
haps, for ever irrecoverable. But when
Qintilian tells us, our Orator opened
his Oration in a timid‚ low, submiffive
Tone of Voice, and imagines his Affion
was suited to that Tone, does he not
ascribe rather too much to his Timidity
and Submiffion? Should he not recol—
ΙΕξὶ, that the Solemnity of Prayer re·
quires a solemn Firmness in the Voice,
and an Αξὶίοη of superior Dignity?

W'ould not any Affion of this temperate·
Kind be much unequal to the Vehemence:

and Ardour and Sublimity of this Em¹
ordinm ?
