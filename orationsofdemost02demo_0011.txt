ADVERTISEMEN'I'.

valuable Work cannot want my Testimony to its Merit. Lct
me however be permitted to say, that whatever 'l'hanks are

due to the Diligence and Accuraey of collating Manuscript-‚v
and Editions‚ or of searching through all the Writers of An-
tiquity for Paffage8‚ that might ascertain the original Text,
are undoubtedly due to this Gentleman. A great Number of
conjeetural Emendations will certainly do honour to his critical
Sagacity3 but his peculiar Merit confists in his Knowledge
of the Athenian Courts of Judicature 3 their Laws and Usages‚
and Terms employed in their Pleadings ; a Kind of Erudition,
that was greatly wanted, and absolutely neceffary to explain a
thousand Difficulties in these Orations.

How much 1 am indebted to this Writer will appear in every
Page‚ and almost in every Sentence of the following Transsa-

tion. Yet, it may be objedted‚ I have sometimes differed from
him in Opinion. Never without Unwillingness and Appre-
henfion 3 certainly never in a Presumption of that Equality οι·

Superiority, which Difference in Opinion generally supposes.

I HAVE now finished a difficult and a laborious Task.
Whatever may be the Merit or Success of this Transsation‚ I

can truly say I have endeavoured to deserve the public Appro-
bation3 to be just to my Subscribers‚ and grateful to the Gen-

tleman, who has honoured it with his Patronage.
