IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPI-ION. 489

but the Fathers and Brothers of the deceased, who were ap-

pointed to perform their Obsequies, entertained, with regard
to me, the same favourable Sentiments 3 and when they were
obliged to givea funeral Supper in Honour os the dead, which,
according to ancient Custom, was to be given in the Housc of
their nearest Relation, they gave itin mine, and certainly with
the utmost Justice. Because, though each of them separatcly ‘
was more nearly related in Blood to each of the deceased, yet

none of them in general was so nearly allied to them all, either
in Affefflon or Interest. For he, to whom their Safety and
Success were of greatest Importance‚ must certainly have born
sor their Misfortune, would to the Gods, that such Misfortune

had never happened ! a greater Proportion of the public Sorrow.
But read him the Inscription, which the Republic ordered to

be engraved on the Monument ereeted to their Memory, that:
you may be obliged, AEschines‚ to acknowledge yourself a

prostitute Slanderer and Informer.

The INSCRIPTION.
To save their Country from impending Shame,
To guard her Freedom, and affert her Fame,
They shone in Arms; the dreadful Battle led,
And the fierce Foe beneath their Valour bled.
All Care of Life, indignant, they despise3
Their Umpire Death, and Liberty the Prize.
They fought, that Greece her F reedom might maintain,

Nor feel the haughty Victor’s galling Chain.
