324 ORATION OF AESCHINES

Is the Name of the Generals inscribed upon any of these
Mercuries Ρ No 3 that of the People. Approach therefore,
in Imagination, the Portico‚ for its Paintings called the various,
where you frequently affemble, and where all the Monuments
of your memorable Aetions are depofited. You ask, Athenian8‚
what I mean by such a Proposal ? There the Battle of Marathon
is painted. Who was the Commander in chief upon that im·-
portant Day? You can all answer, Miltiades. Yet his Name

is not written upon the Pieture. Wherefore ? Did he not
solicit this Reward ? He did solicit‚ and the People refused it.

Yet instead of his Name they permitted him to be drawn the
principal F igure in the Piece, and in an Attitude‚ that distin—
guisbed him auimating the Soldiers to their Duty. In the
Temple of the Mother of the Gods, near the Senate-House‚ we
may still behold what Rewards you gave the LeaderS, who
brought home the People from their Exile in Phyle. Archinus,
one ofthese Leaders, proposed a Decree, and carried it without
Oppofition, in which he direeted, that a thousand Drachmas
should be given to the Persons, whom he brought home from
Phyle, for Sacrifices and monumental Offerings to the Gods ς
the whole amounting to somewhat less than ten Drachmas‚ each
Person. He then ordered, that they should be crowned with
an Olive, not a golden Crown. For in those Days a Crown
of Olive was held in Honour, though now a golden one is· de-

spised. Nor did he suffer these Crowns to be given without due
Cauti0n‚ but direcffted the Senate to· enquire with their stristest

Care
