Courage and their Hopes to the Danger, and resolute to bear ’

they had acquired 3 neither confidering the numberless Wrongs

you had received from that very People‚ in whose Detence you

might offend, you would reserve your Resentment for some

other Occafion, and neither remember nor demand an Account
of their Offence8‚ when either their Safety, or their Liberty μ

were in Danger. ‚
