424 DEMOSTHENES

lumniate the Cstizeu, who proposes to you the most salutary
Counsels, and thus exchange the real Advantages of the Com-
monweulth for the trivi-al Pleasure and Gratification of listening
to Calumnies and Invectives. From thence, it becomes more
easy, and far less dangerous for them, who are servilely devoted
to your Enemies‚ to receive the Reward of their Perfidy, than

for a faithful Cifizen, and zealous of your Welfare, to accept

of an meloyment in your Administration.

BEFORE the War was openly proclaimed it was impious, O
Parth and Heaven! to have affisted Philip. Can the Charge
of Impiety be denied in an A& of T reason against our Country ?

Pardon him however, if such be your good Pleasure 3 pardon this
Irnpiety. But when our Ships were openly plundered, Cherso-

nesus laid waste, and Philip had invaded even the Territories

of Athens; when the Affair was 110 longer Matter of Doubt‚
but Hostilities were actually commenced, yet this Sychophant,
who mouths his Iambics so tragically, harh hot one Decree,
whether of greater or less Importance, to produce for the Ad-

vantage of the Republic. If he dares affert the contrary, let
him produce it in these Hours allotted for my Defence. But

there is not any such Decree. From whence, one of these two
Conscqucnces must necessarily follow, either that he was inca-

pable of finding Fault with my Condffl, and therefore did not
offer any other Decrees 3 or being solicitous to promote the In-

tercsts of our EncmieS, was determined not to propose any
better
