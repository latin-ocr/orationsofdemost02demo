392 DEMOSTHENES

tember, with Con sent of the Senate3 the Magistrates and Generals,
having first made Report to the Senate of what had paffed in
the Affembly, declax-ed that the People had determined, Amss
baffadors shall be sent to Philip to solicit the Restitution of
their ships, and that proper Instructions be given them, be·-
fides this Decree of the Affembly. Cephisophon‚ Democritus
and Polycritus were ele&ed; the Tribe Hyppothoon prefided
in the Senate, Aristophon, the Prefident, made the Motion for

this Decree.

As Ι produce these Decroes, so should you, AEschines, pro-

duce those, that Ι have preferred, by which you may convict
me of having been the Occafion of the War. But impoffible.

If you had any such Decrees‚ it was your Interest to have irn-
mediately shewn them. Neither indeed does Philip himself
impute any Blame to me with regard to the War, although he
complains of others most severely. Read his Letter.

Pfflm's LETTER.

Pfflm, King of the Macedoniam, to the Senate and People
of Athens, Greeting. Your Ambaffadors are arrived here, and

have remonstrated to me concerning the Dismission of those ,
Ships, that Leodamas commanded. Upon the whole of this
Mamer, yo⁰u appear to me to have acted with uncommon Weak-
nest, if you could imagine, Ι am ignorant of the real Desti-
nation of these ships, or their being sent under Pretence of

trans porting
