DEMOSTHENES. 117

Sedition rages3 WarS‚ long-ssumbering, rise,
And the lov’d Youth in Prime of Beauty dies;

For soon the Foe lays waste that hapless State,
Where joyless Discord dwells, and foul Debate.

For the poor Wretch an harder Lot remains,
Sold like a Slave to pine in foreign Chains.
His proper Woes the Man of 'Wealth awast,
Bound o'er his Walls, and thunder at his Gate3
Close on th' unhappy Fugitive they press,
And find him in his Chamber’s dark recesS.

Thus my good Genius speak8‚ and bids advise
The Sons of Athens to be just and wise3
To mark attentive what a Stream of Woes
From civil Discord‚ and Contention flows3

What beauteous Order shines, where Justice reigns,
And binds the Sons of Violence in Chains.

Folly‚ of thousand F orms‚ before her flies,
And in the Bud the flowering Mischief dies,

She guides the Judge's Sentence, quells the proud,
And midst Sedition’s Rage appalls the Croud 3

While clamorous F aetion, and Contention cease,.
And Man is blest with Happpiness and Peace„

Do you not hear, O Men of AthenS, what Solon declares
of such-Men, and his Opinion of the GfodS‚ whom he calls the

Guazdians,
