to the Pythian Games, nor the Persons, usually appointed
to regulate them ; while you deserted these Solemnities‚ so

much honoured by your Ancestors‚ this Man went to those
triumphal FeastS, which the Thebans and Philip celebrated

Destruffion of the Cities, TerritorieS, and Arms of our Conse-

Paean of ViAEt-ory, and drank with him in Familiarity and

F riendship. Nor is it possible, that we should differ in the Re—

presentation of these Faets. His Oath is still preserved in the
I 2 Temple
