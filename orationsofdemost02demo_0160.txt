THAT these Misfortunes have undoubtedly been produced by
Corruption, and that your Ambaffadors received the Priee of
this Corruption, is already manifest to you, Ι presume, in num⁶
berless Instances‚ and I am appl‘ehenfive, that, contrary to my:
mentions, by endeavouring with too much Solicitude to de„
monstrate their Guilt, I may grow tedious by a Repetition off
what you already know. Hear me, however, in one Instance

because he had hospitably received his Fellow-Citizens. (5 7) Thus
