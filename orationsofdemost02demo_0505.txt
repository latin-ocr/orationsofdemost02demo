IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 493
to Alexander 3 who measured their Happiness by their Appe-

titeS, and infamous Exceffes3 who totally ruined that Spirit of
Independence 3 l that Resolution never to endure a Master, in
which our Forefathers bounded their Ideas of Happiness‚ and
made the great Rule of all their Aetions. Yet never was this
Conspiracy, so shameful and so notorious 3 never was this A&
· of Villainy, this Treason rather (for such the proper Language)
against the Liberties of Greece, attributed by the rest of Man-
kind, to the Republic, for following my CounseIS‚ nor by you
imputed to my Administration. JDost thou demand then, for
what Virtue, I think myself worthy of Honour ? This is my
Answer3 because, when every other Magistrate, employed in
condufflng the Affairs of Greece, and you among the first,
was corrupted, formerly by Philip, ancl now by Alexander,
never did the Difficulties of Conjund'cures, nor the Blandish-
ments of Words, nor the Mightiness of Psoniise8‚ nor Hope‚
nor Fear‚ nor Favour, nor any other Motive‚ influence or in-

duce me to betray whatever Ι thought just in itself‚; or useful to
my Country31 because, in all the Counsels Ι have given the
AthenianS‚ 1 never inclined, as you and your Affociates have
done, like the Ballance to its Weight‚ but gave my Advice
with an upright, honest, and uncorrupted Spirit; because,}⁵1
have been intrusted with the Direfflon of more important
Affairs than any other Man of this Age, and have executed every
Trust with a religious Purity; with Integrity‚ and Simplici-
ty. For these Reasons I do esteem myself worthy of Honour. θ’
