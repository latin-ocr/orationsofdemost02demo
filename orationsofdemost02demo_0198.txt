186 ORATION OF

1 too delired you to recollect all these Circumstances‚ and to

emulate the Wisdom of your,Ancest0rs‚ but to guard against
their Errourz, and ill vtimed Spirit of Faetion. I recommended
to you to imitate with Ardour their Victories over the Perfians,
at Flamen, Salamis and Marath0n3 the Sea-fight at Artemisium,
and the Condivft of Tolmidas, who marched in Security with
a thousand chofen Athenians through Peloponnesu8‚ an Enemy's
Country3 but to avoid the Sicilian Expeditior), in which they
sent Succours to the Leontines, even while the Lacedaemonians
had made an Incurfion into their own Territories‚ and Decel'ia
was fortified against them. Iad'vised you to avoid their last
Iniprudence‚ when although they were unsuccessful in the War,
and the Lacedaemonians invited them to Peace3 although,
befides Attica, they were in Poffesfion of LemnOS‚ Imbros and
Scyros 3 while their democratical Constitution of Government,
established by Law, was yet unviolated‚ yet they refused all
Proposals, and determined to carry on a war, they were un-
able to support. Cleophon‚ a Maker of Lyres‚ whom many
People remembered in the Shackles of a Slave, threatened to cut
any Man's T hroat with his Sword‚ who even mentioned the
Nanie of Peace. To such Extremity did they, at length, reduce>
the Republic‚ that they were abundantly satisfied to conclude
a peace, after having ceded all their Dominions, rased the
walls of Athens, received a Lacedaemonian Gari-ison and Go-
vernor, and surrendered their Democracy to thirty Tyrants, who

put to Dcath fifteen hundred CitizenS‚ esven without a Trial.
