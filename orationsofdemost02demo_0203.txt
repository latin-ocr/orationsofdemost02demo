AESCHINES. 191

Is it not then, Athenians, most terrible‚ that any Man
shall dare to utter such Falsehoods against a Fellow Cstizcn,
not his indeed, for· there I would corre& myself, but yours,
when under the Danger of a capital Trial? Did not our An-
cestors wisely ordain in Prosecutions for Murder in our great
Court of Judicature, the Palladium, when they obliged the
Person, who was acquitted‚ to take out the Bowels of the dead
Body‚ and to swear (and this ancient Custom is still preserved)
*that the Judges, who had determined in his Favour‚ had pro-
nounced a just and upright Sentence? If otherwise, he impre-
cated Perdition to himself and his Family, while he prayed for
'every Blessing to his Judges. This Institution, Atheniens,
was of much Wisdom and good Policy. (22) For if none of
you would willingly charge himself with pronouncing Sentence on
the guilty, (23) much more should you avoid condemning the

innocent by a Sentence‚ which takes away his Life, 01· deprives
him

(22) Perhaps this Paffige is not so
difficult as the Transsator imagines, foi·
otherwise our Commentators would not
‘ have paffed it over in Silence. Stephans
understands it in a Manner very different
from that of Wolfius and his Editors.
He gives his Opinicn upon it with a Mo—
desty befitting his great Learning, qui-
bus verbis puio eum innuere, and the pre-
sent Transsation follows his Opinion‚ as
well ashis Reading‚ τέμνον-τας Ta* τόμια,
which makes a considerable Alter-arion
in the Sense. Yet still the Expreffions
Ἑαυτὸν οἱνοιπλῆσαι φὸνε ἕικοῖικ---ῗᾷπκ
α’ἑῗίκὸ are unexplaffied, and the Reason-

ing is inconclusive and obscure. Some

of our Critics, in almost all other In-
stan-ces sojudicious, would here very un-
neceffarily read νικῶντα for νικῶντας,
and unhappily confine the Spirit and Li-
berty of Oratory and Orators by the meer
Meclianism ofgrarnmatical Rules. How-
ever, when Scaliger proposes τεμυίντα
τοὶ τόμια applied [Ο 1) κῑῖυτα he seems to
point to the true Readlng and Construc—
tlon.

(23) It should siem by this Custosn,
that the Judges iznagined themselves ab·
solved srom any Eri'our in acquitting the
Person, prosecuted for Mmder, if Le
swore to the Justice of their Sentence.
