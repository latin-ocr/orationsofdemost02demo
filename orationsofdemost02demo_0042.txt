30 ORATIONSOF

concluded between Philip and the Thebans, when every Thing
was ruined, and brought to their final Period. How is this
manifest? The twenty-{eventh the Senate affembled in the
Pyraeum upon the State of your Marine„ when Dercyllus ar·-
rived from Chalcis, and gave you an Account‚ that Philip had
delivered every Thing into the Hands of the Thebans. He
reckoned that Day the fifth from the conclusion of the Treaty,
and the twenty-third, fourth, fifth, fixth, and seventh, make
exa-{ily the five Days, which Dereyllus computed from the
Treaty. Thus by an exa& Calculation of the Days, upon
which these Ambaffadors made their Report of their Embaffy,
and published their Decree‚ they stand convieted of having stre-
nuoussy assisted Philip, and aeted in Concert with him for the

Destrufflon of the Phocaeans.

Bsssmas, that none of the Phocaean Cities were taken by
Siege, or by Affault‚ but were utterly ruined by' the Treaty
they had coneludcd, is a convincing Proof, that they suffered
these Calanfities, because they were persuaded by your Ambas—
sadors, that Philip would preserve them. For they were not
ignorant of Philip's Charadter. Here, give me our Treaty
with the Phocaeans, and the Decrees by which Philip rased

their walls, that you may behold what Alliance subfisted be-
tween υς, and what Misfortuncs have befallen thern through

the Counsels of these Enemies of the Gods. Read.
