AGAINST CTESIPHON. 345

⁷ Demosthenes, you are neither honoured with Crowns or Procla-
mations, shall Demosthenes himself be proclaimed? Yet if any
of our Tragic Poets‚ whose Plays shall be brought upon the
Stage immediately after the Ceremony of his being crowned,
should introduce Therfites crowned by the Greeks, you never
would endure it3 because Homer calls him a Coward and a
Calumniator. But if you crown our present Thersites, do you
not imagine, the Grecians will treat you with the utmost De-

rifion and Contempt?

YotJR Ancestors ascribed whatever was glorious and splendid
in their Ac‘tions to the People; whatever was less important, or
less successful was imputed to the Counsels of their corrupted
Orators. But Ctesiphon is of Opinion, we should take away
our present Ignominy from Demosthenes, and tranfer it to the
People. You profess yourselves most happy in the good Favour
of F ortune, and with Reason make the Profeffion. Will you
therefore by your own Decree declare, you are deserted by For-
tune, and preserved by Demosthenes? Yet of all things most
absurd, in these very Courts of Justice you brand with Infamy
the Man, who has been convidted upon an Aetion of Bribery,
and will you crown this Demosthenes, whose whole Admi-
nistration you are conscious hath been corrupt? You rigoroussy

fine the Judges, who do not impartially distribute the Prizes
to the Dancers in our Bacchanalian Games, and will you, who

are appointed Judges, not of Dances, but of Laws and civil
