AGAINST CTESIPHON. 339

BUT I am neither ambitious of imitating the Conversation of

DemostheneS, nor ashamed of my own. The Speeches 1 have
made in this Affembly, I neither wish unspoken, nor would ac-
cept of Life upon the Terms of having pronounced his Decla-
mations. The Temperance of my Life, Demosthenes, hath
given and preserved to me, that Silence you calumniate. Con-
tented with my little Fortune, 1 do not sordidly wissi for more.
Froni thence I am either filent, or I speak, as Iam influenced

by Judgement or Inclination3 not compelled by the profligate
Expence of luxurious Appetites. But yon, Iconceive, when
you have received your Price, are most profoundly silent ε when
you have lavished it away, grow clamorous again. On the con-

trary, you never speak, either when, or what you pleasc, but

when and what your Paymasters command. Nor are you a-
lhamed of boasting in your Vanity, what the next, immediate
Hour convicts of F alsehood. Even this Prosecution, which you
affure us was undertaken, not for the Sake of the Common-
wealth, but to ingratiate myself with Alexander, was begun
while Philip was yet alive3 when Alexander was not yet seated
on the Throne3 before you had seen your Vifions of Pausanias,

or held your ‘nocturnal Dialogues With Juno and Minerva.
