IN'DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 423

CARLIDEMth, Hyperides, and NicomachUS, having been
duly sworn before the Generals, deliver this Testimony in F a—
vour of Demosthenes : That they saw AEschines entering by
Night into the House of Thraso, and their holding secret Con-
ference with Anaxinus‚ who was generally reputed the Spy of
Philip. This Testimony is dated the third of July, under the
Archonffiip of Nicias.

ations. But Faus of this Kind make not any just Impreffion
upon your Memories, nor excite that Indignation they deserve.
You have indulged (by unhappy Custom) an unbounded Licence
to every Declaimer, who thinks proper, to supplant and ca-

lumniate
