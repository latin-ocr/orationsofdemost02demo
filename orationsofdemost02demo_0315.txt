AGAINST CTE81PHoN. 303
gainst the military, Art3 for he boasted, that he himself had

rendered you many more valuable Services on that Tribunal‚

than you had ever received from your Generals and their Coun-

cils of War.

BE1NG appointed Paymaster of our mercenary Troops he a-
maffed an immense Sum by false Musters‚ by robbing the rni—
litary Chest, and letting out ten thousand of those Troops to
the Amphiffaeans. Even while Ι called Heaven and Earth to
witness against him, and exclaimed in Bitterness of Anguish in
your Affemblies, he left the Republic defenceless and exposed
to every Danger, by suddenly and surreptitioussy ordering them-
away. For what, do you imagine, did Philip put up his Vows
to Heaven with greatest Ardour at that Conjundrure ? Was it
not, that he might engage separately with your national Soldiery²
and separately with your foreign Troops at Amphissa, and then-
invade the other States of Greece, dispirited and intimidated by so.-
severe a Blow? Yet DemostheneS, the Author of all these Cala-
mities, is not content with Impunity, but resents his not beingv

rewarded even with a golden Crown. He deems it not sufficient.
to be proclaimed in your Presence, but is grievoussy offmded,
if the Proclamation be not made before all the Grecians. Thus„
as it often appears, a depraved Nature, when poffeffed of too
much Power„ works out the Destruffion of a‘ free People.
