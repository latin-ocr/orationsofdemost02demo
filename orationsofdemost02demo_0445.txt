IN DEFENCE OF CTESIPHON. 433

Advice of those, who join us with all their Forccs‚ and shall
certainly chastise those, who do not obey our Orders. Farcwcll.

BEHOLD,:³ how he avoids mentioning his real Motives‚ and
conceals himself under his Zeal for the Amphictyon&¹¹ But
who concerted these Measures with him, and cooperated with
him in the Execution? Who furnished him with these Pre-
tences? Who was the principal Author of all our Calamities?
Was not this Traitor AEschines? Do not therefore, O Men

of Athens, as you wall< and converse together, ascribe the Mi-
series of Greece to one Man alone. Not by one Man alone, Ι ,

here attest the Powers of Earth ancl Heaven, but by a Multi-
tude of abandoned Wretches, dispersed through all our Re-
publics‚ and among whom AEschines may be justly numbered‚

have we been thus totally undone; this AEsthines, whom, if
it were neceffary to make 'the plain and unreserved Declaration‚

Ι should not hesitare to declare the universal Ruin of all the Men,
the Territories and Cities‚ that have been destroyed in Conse-

quence of these fatal Measures, because, whoever sows the Seed,
is Author of the Harvest: this AEschineS, from whom, I am
astonished, that you do not instantly turn away, whenever you
meet him, with Averfion and Horrour. But thick and impe-

netrable is the Darkness, for so it appearS‚ that hathintervened

between you and Truth.

IT hath happened, while Ι have thus lightly touched upon· V·

his Perfidy to his Country‚ that l have regularly come to the
Vox„ ΙΙ. K k k Mensores,
