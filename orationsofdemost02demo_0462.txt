450 DEMOSTHENES

three Days Journey from Attica, such Alarms of Dangergr'
such Terrors surrounded the City ; what might we not justly
have expeeted, had this great Calamity befallen us within our

two, or three Days contributed to the Preservation of Athens.
But it were an ungrateful Office to repeat the Calamities‚ that-
poffibly might have happened in such ar Situation, and which,

Alliance, which you malignantly censure, the Republic never

experienced‘..

'l'hings I do not yet mention) I so far approved myself a better

Citizen than you, as I devoted myself to the vigorous Execu—
