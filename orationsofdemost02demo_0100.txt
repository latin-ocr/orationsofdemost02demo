permit me to tell you a little Story, although it hath not indeed
any Relation to this Embaffy. When Philip had taken Olynthus,

To this Festival and
its Solemnity he invited all the Comedians of Greece. Making

he celebrated the Olympio Games. (3 ι)

Entertainments for them, and crowning the Vffiors, he ass<ed
Satyrus, the Comedian‚ why he alone had never made him any
Request, or whether he had ever perceived in him any Sordid-
ness of Spirit, or any particular Dissike towards him? Satyrus,
as they report‚ made him this Answer3 that he was not covetous

proper Chamfter, the grand Corruptor,
searching into the Hearts‚ and purchafing
the Secrets of Mankind. The modest
Diffidence of Satyrus is finely opposed to
th‘e Arrogance of Philip, who promises
whatever he asked, while the Orator in-
sinuatos, that ir AEschines had interceded
in this Manner sor the Phocaeam, Philip
would have felt the Sentiments of hu-
man Nature, and he would have suc--
cecded in his Request.
