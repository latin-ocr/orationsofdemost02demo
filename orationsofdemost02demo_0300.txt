288 ORATION OF AESCHINES

Tm: ΟΑἾἪ AND IMPRECATION.

AFTER this Imprecation, these Oaths, this Oraele‚ still ex-
tant in our public Records, the Amphiffaean LocrianS, or the

Persons rather, who prefided in their Counci13‚ Violators of all
Laws, again cultivated this Land z again fortified and inhabited
this unhallowed and accursed Port; exasted Customs from
whoever sailed along their CoastS‚ and corrupted certain of the
DeputieS, who were going to the general Affembly at Delphos,
one of whom was Demosthenes. He had been appointed by
your Decrees your Deputy at the Council, and received a thou-
sand Drachmas from the AmphiffaeanS, not to mention them to
the Ampliic’tyons. It was stipulated besides, that twenty Minae
should be sent him hither yearly for ever out of the nefarious
and execrable Customs of their Port, for which, by every poffible
Method‚ he should prote& them in Athens. From this im-
pious Corruption it hath appeared, even more remarkably than

formerly, that whenever he hath engaged in the Interest of
either private Cifizen, or Magistrate, or Republic, he hath in-
volved them in Misfortunes incurable.

Now behold how Fate and Fortune avenged the Sacrilege
of the Amphiffaeans. When Theophrastus was Archon, and

Diognetus

Temple, ἵνα ὃν) τῷ τεμένει τέ 'A- ’γῆςῆθεέλασο-α, 1111ti11t11eseauraffied the

PAUSANIAS. TheOracle, according to ever would reconcile these Differences
