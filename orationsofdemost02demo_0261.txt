AGAINST CTESIPHON. 249

“ Proclamation, derived to us from our Ancestors, and sup-
“ ported by our Laws3 WHo wrm, Accusss? Permit our
“ Citizens‚ whoever pleases, to make it Matter of Doubt‚

“ whether you have really given thus liberally, or of the nu-
“ merous Sums, still in your Hands for repairing the Walls,

“ whether you have expended buta very inconfiderable Part,
“ although you received ten Talents for that Purpose. Do not

“ extort from us this Glory of being liberal; (tear not, from the
“ Hands of your JudgeS, those Tablets, by which they shall
“ pronounce your Sentence3 nor presume to diremit, but be
‘· content as a Citizen to follow the Laws3 for such Conduft

“ only can support a democratical State.'''

IN Answer to the weak Praetexts therefore, which they will
hereafter urge, I have hitherto spoken. But that Demosthenes,
when Ctesiphon preferred this Decree, was really accountable‚
as a Magistrate prefiding over the F unds belonging to the The-
atre, and those destined for repairing our Walls ; and that he
hath never given you an Account of his Condue‘c, or of the
Money committed to his Care in either of these Employments,
I shall now endeavour to convince you by the public Records.
Read therefore under whose Archonssiip, in what Month‚ what
Day‚ and what Affembly‚ Demosthenes was elected into the
· Managementksof the theatrical Funds, from whence it will

appear, that Ctefiphon preferred a Decree to crown him, when
only half his Magistracy was expired01 Read.
