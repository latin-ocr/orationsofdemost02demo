274 ORATION OF AESCHINES

worthless Citizen in Athens, will never become an honourable
and faithful Ambaffador in Macedonia¹ He hath not changed
his Genius, but only altered his Situation.

F Rom whence he hath maintained so various a Charaeter in
various Conjunctures (for this the second Period of his Admi-
nistration) or what Cause can be affigned‚ ‘why Philocrates, en-
gaged in the same political Measures with Demosthenes, was
driven into Banishment for Crimes against the State, While De-
mosthenes continues a public Accuser 31 and by What Means this
execrable Wretch -hath plunged us into these our present Cala-

mities, are Circumstances more especially worthy of your
Attention.

As soon therefore as Philip had marched into the Streights
of Thermopylae ; unexpeetedly destroyed the Cities of the Pho·
caeans, and rendered the Thebans, as you then judged, more
powerful, than the Conjunehire itself, and your Interests would
allow; when, terribly ahrmed, you carried your Effeets out

of the open Country into the City3 the severest Accusations
were formed against the AmbaffadorS, who negotiated the.-
Peace‚ but beyond all others against Philocrates and Demost-
henes, who had not only ratified the Peace during their Ern-
baffy, but preferred the Deci-ee, ly which it was conclucledcr
It ¹happened at the same Time, that Demosthenes and Philocra-
tes quarrelled for almost the very Reasons you yourselves sus-

percted.
