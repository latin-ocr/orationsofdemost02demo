190 ORATION OF

received this Declaration with repeated Clamours, and called upon
the Prefidents by their Names to come forward on the Tribu-
nal, you confirmed the Decree in Oppofition to his Opinion.
In P'roof of these TruthS, summon Aleximachus‚ who preferred,

the Decree, and the Colleagues of DemostheneS, when he was
Prefident. Then read their Testimony.

The TESTIMONY.

DEMOSTHENES, therefore, who lately wept over the Name
of Chersobleptes, appears evidently to have excluded him from

the general Confederacy. As soon as that Affembly was dis-
miffed, Philip’s Ambaffadors tendered the Oaths to our Con-
federates in the Court appointed for the Councils of your

Generals. Yet my Prosecutor had the Affurance to tell you,
that I had driven Critobulus, the Ambaffador of Chersobleptes,

from the Sacrifices, in Presence of your Confedmtes, while the
People were deliberating on their Decree, and the Generals
were fitting in Council. Whence had Ι such Authority?

How was the Affair passed over in Silence? If 1 had dated to
aetii] sucha Manner, would you, Demosthenes, have suffered
it? Would you not have filled the Affembly with Vociferation'
and Clamour, if you had seen me, as you lately affirmed, driv„
ing an Ambaffador from the sacrifices? But let the Crier
summon the GeneraIS, and the Deputies of the Consederates‚

that you may hear their Evidence.

The Evmssucss.
