gress, and their Payment of Subfidies‚ by which a future War
—could alone be maintained, he pofitively sold, clothing with
sairest Words the most dishonourable Deed3‚ and impelling you
by very Violence of Words (12) to believe it was the Duty of
this Republic, first effeetually to succour whatever Grecians irn-

Benefits‚ you had conferred. (Ι 3) That you may be perfeffly

There seems however more Generofity

whom they had obliged, than from whom
they had received Obligations.
