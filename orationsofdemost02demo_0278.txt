266 ORATION OF AESCHINES

PHILOCRATES preferred a Decree‚ that Philip might be
permitted to send Heralds and Ambaffadors hither to nego-

tiate an AUiance, offenfive and defensive. This Decree
was opposed as contrary to Law. The Day of Trial came 3,
Lycium, who laid the Indictnient, entered upon the Prose-

cution. Philocrates made his Defence 3. Demosthenes supported
him, and Philocrates was acquitted. The following Year The-

mistocles is made Archon. ''Then enters the Senator Demost*
henes into the Senate-House‚ neither chosen by Lot in his own
Right, nor appointed to succeed upon a Vacancy either by
Death or Misconduet of any of the Senator3‚ but getting a Seat
by Bribery and Intrigue‚ with an Intention upon al] Occasions¹
both of speaking and acting in support of Philocrates 3 as the
Event itself hath demonstrated. l For Philocrates violently:
carried another Decree‚ in which he commanded, that ten¹
Ambaffadors should be chosen, who shall solicite Philip to send
his Plenepotentiaries hither to negotiate a Peace. One of these
was Demosthenes, who returning from Macedonia, pronounced
a Panegyric on the Peace, and made the very same Reports,

as his Colleagues, of their Negotiations. Yet he alone of all·
our Senators proposed a Decree‚ for concluding a Peace with
the Herald and Ambaffadors of Philip, in perfeet Conformity

with the Decrees of Philocrates. He gave Philip Leave to send
Heralds and Ambaffadors hither, and Demosthenes concludes
the Treaty. Give me now your earnest Attention to the Circum-

starice5‚ that followed. Very little Bufiness was transacted by
Philip
