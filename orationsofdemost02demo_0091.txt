DEMOSTHENEs‚ 79

Prisoners3 to carry them Money for their Ransom, and preserve
them, to the utmost of my Power. It were therefore highly
crimina] to break my Faith‚ and abandon our Citizens in their
Misery. But to have wandered about the Country in a private
Charadter, by refusing the Embaffy, was neither honourable,

nor* without Danger3 and may I perish instantly, and come to
an untimely End, if 1 did not consent to be an Ambaffador only

with an Intention of preserving our Citizens3 or if ever Ι pur-
posed to join with my Colleagues in receiving these immoderate
Sums of Money. ‘⁶ But the Proof.’' When in our third Em-
baffy, you twice appointed me an Ambaffador, Ι twice refu-
sed, and during our other Journey constantly opposed them.
Your Affairs‚ when I had any Authority in the Embaffy, were
thus conducted for your Interest, but when they, by having a
Majority of Votes‚ undertook the direetion of them, they were
every where ruined: and yet they would have been successful,
if my Advice had any Influence. Neither am I so miserably
infatuated‚ or so senseless, as to have given away my own For-
tune for your Service, while I beheld others receiving large
Sums from Philip, yet not have endeavoured to do whatever
might have been done without Expence, and with greater Ad-
vantage to the Republic. Indeed, O Men of Athens, Ishould
have endeavoured it with Earnestness, but I imagine, they

would have had a greater Superiority over me, if Ι had gone in

that Embaffy. (27) N
