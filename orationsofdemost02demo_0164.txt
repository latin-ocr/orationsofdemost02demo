PERHAPS it may be necessary to say something of his Voice‚
for Ι am informed he greatly vaunts him of its Sweetness‚ as if
he intended to exercise his theatrical Talents upon this Occasion-
Yet in my Opinion, if, when he played the character of
ThyesteS, or represented the Miseries of the Trojan War, you⁴

drove him off the Stage with Hiffes, and only not with StoneS,
in such a Manner, that he had very nearly defisted, in the

Article of Death, from playing any more third—rate Characters,
it would surely be exceffively absurd, if afterwards, when he
harh wrought a thousand Mischiefs, not upon the Scene, but

in the public and most important Affairs of the Commonwealth,
you should listen to him, as an Orator. N03 may you never
commit such an Absurdity. When you make Trial of an He-
rald, you should indeed be attentive to his having a good Voice,
but in choofing an Ambaffador‚ or any public Minister, it is
your Interest to fix upon a Man of Integrity, and zealous for
your Welfare. With regard to myself, Inever looked up to

Feet, and sang Paeans of Victory with him, and treated you

with Contempt.
