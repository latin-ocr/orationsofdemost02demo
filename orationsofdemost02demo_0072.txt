60 ORATIONS OF⁷

Temple of the Mother of the Gods among your Records, over
which a public Guatdian is appointed3 and the Decree, which
was made upon the Occafion of his refusing this Embasfy‚ is
there accurately written. With Regard to his Condue't in Ma·

Cedonia, his Colleagues, and other Persons, who are here pre-

sent, will give Evidence against him3 they, who have given
me this Information, for 1 was not of the Embass‘y, but dis.
charged myself by Oath of the Office. Now read me the De-

cree and the Record3 then call the Witneffes.

The Deoua. The choan. The Wrrmzssm.

Bu‘r what Prayers do you imagine did Philip make to the
Gods, when he performed his Libations? what did the Thebans

make? Did they not pray for Strength in War; for Vidtory to
themselves and their Confederates, and the contrary to those of
of the Phocaeans? AEschines therefore joined in these Prayers,

and denounced against his Country those Imprecations, which
it is your Duty now to retort upon his Head. He went to
Macedonia in Violation of the Law, which pronounces Death
upon such an offence, and when he had arrived there, he was

apparently guilty of such Crimes, as merit other Deaths. His
Affions before he went, and his Condu& during his Embaffy

might execute the Sentence of Death upon him, with the
strietest Justiee.
