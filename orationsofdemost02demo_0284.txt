The Dsscwss. The PRESIDENT.

EXCELLENT, O Athenian3‚ excellent indeed, the Preserva-
tion of our public Aeisg for they remain unmoveable, nor ever
vary with those, who desert from Party to Party in their Poli-
tics, butgive the People a Power‚ whenever they please‚ of in-
speffing' into the Lives of those, who were formerly guilty of
the most execrable Cri1ne8‚ and yet upon any Alteration of Af-
fairs assume the Charaeter of being valuable and upright Citi-

zens.

IT now 1611131113, that I-mention some Instances of the servile

Complianees of Demosthenes with regard to Philip. Although
he had been a Senator a whole Year‚ he never invited any fo·-
reign Ambaffadors to the front Seats in the Theatre. This

was the first and only Instance. He placed the Macedonian
Ambaffadors there, laid their Cushions himself, spread the

purple Carpcts on their Seats, and at the first Appearance of
Da y- L'ght‚ conduffissed them into the Theatre‚ in such a Man-

n es ‚ as to be hiffed 101 his Turpitude and Adulation. (8) When
they departed for Thebes, he liberally hired fix Mules for them,
a 1d marched before them 1n much Solemnsty, making the Re-

pubhc

(8) Tls 18 Instmce of Adu1at30n· 13 well Cushions to fit upon in the Theatue.
explained by a Paffage m Theophrastus,13ut the F latterer can descend to the Vile-
quoted by Tomeil. A Slave was ap· ness of snatching one for his Patron, and
mate} to give People of DistinCtion placing it 1111111611 on his Scat. 3
