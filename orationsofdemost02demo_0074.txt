Bur perhapsuthey may urge it as an Objeffiom that it will
be the Beginning of another Qarrel with Philip, if you should
condemn the AmbaffadorS, who concluded the Peace. If* this

Objection be just, I cannot conceive it poffible to accuse ΖΕΓ-
chines of a greater Crime. Because, if Philip, who gave
Money‚ that he might obtain a Peace‚ be now become so

formidable and powerful‚ that you must no longer regard your
Oaths‚ or the Justice of this Trial‚ but only confidet with
your best Attention in what Manner you may oblige him, what

Punishme'nt, proportioned to their CrimeS‚ can they suffer, who

have been the Authors of these Calamities? On the contrary, ·

Ι think I can demonstrate, that their Condemnation, if we
may form our Judgement' upon Conjec‘cure5‚ will be rather
‘a Beginning of an advantageous Friendihip with Philip. For
be most affured, he does not, O Men of Athens, despise your
Republic; nor, because he thought you less useful to him than<

the Thebrim, has he therefore preferred their Alliance to yours3
but hc hath been well instrueted by your Ambaffadors, and
harh heard what I have formerly declared to you in your As-
semblics, and what they never contradicted, “ that the People
“ are 011e1neerconfufion3 a Thing of all others most inconstant
“ and faithless ; that as the Waves are agitated in the Ocean, (1 8)·
