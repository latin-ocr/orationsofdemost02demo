260 ORATION OF AESCHINES

to those, who crown him, because you permitted the Procla-

mation. ² To evince this Truth, hear the Laws themselves·

The LAws.

WHEN therefore, with an Intention of deceiving yOU‚ they
shall affirm, that it is written in the LaW, “fet it be permit-
ted to crown in the Theatre if the People shall decree‚’' re-
member to answer them, Yes‚ if any other City crown you 3
but if the People of Athens, the Place is then pointed out to

you, where the Ceremony must be performedl It is absolutely
forbidden to proclaim you out of the general Affembly. For
by this Expreffion, “ Not in any other Place‚'' talk the whole
Day to explain it, you shall never clearly ssww, that you have

preferred a legal Decree.

THERE yet remains one Part of my Accusation‚ to which Ι
am particularly attentive3 {he Praetext‚ upon which Ctesiphon.
supposes Demosthenes worthy of being crowned. l For thus he

speaks in his Decree, “ And the Herald shall proclaim in the
“ Theatre in Presence of all the Grecians, that the People of
‘⁴ Athens crown Demosthenes for his Virtue and Fortitude‚
“ and’' (What is most extraordinary) “ because he constantly
“ pursues in all his Words and Aetions the Welfare of the Re-
“ public.” The Remainder of my Discourse will be to me
extremely fimplffi and to you most easy to form your Judge-

ment upon it. lMy Duty as an Accuser obliges me to inform
you>
