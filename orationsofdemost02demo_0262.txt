250 ORATION OF AESCHINES

COMPUTATION of DAYs.

SHouLD Ι therefore urge no further Proof, Ctefiphon would

be with Justice condemned 3 for not my Accusation condemns
him, but the public Records. Formerly, O Athenians‚ a
Comptroller was appointed, who laid before the People, every
'thirty—five Days, an Account of the public Revenues. But
from the Confidence you placed in Eubulus, they, who were·
ele&ed to superintend your theatrical Funds‚ held at once,

untill Hegemon’s Law, the different Employments of Comp-
trollers‚ Receivers-GenemL Surveyors of the Marine, Inspec'tors»

of our Arsenals, and Overseers of the High-Way33 indeed al-
most all the great Offices of the Administration. Neither do
I purpose to accuse, or refle& any Dishonour upon them, but
I would willingly demonstrate to you, that our-'Legissaton if
the Cidzen, who holds any one even the least considerable

Employment, shall be accountable‚ certainly permits not his
being crowned‚ before he hath given in, and proved his Ac·-
counts. Yet Ctesiphon hath not hefitated to decree a Crown

to Demosthenes, who executed at once all the princi-pal Ma-

gistracies in Athens. l'

T HAT he was really Superintendant for repairing our Walls, when
Ctesiphon preferred this Decree 3 that he had the Management
of the public Revenues; imposed Fines, like other Magistrate33

exercised a judicial Power of determining Causes 3 of all these
Affertions Ι shall produce Demosthenes himself and Ctesiphon
