DEMOSTHENES. ις,

which he informed us he had pronounced against the Thebans
in the presence of Philip; he repeated the general Heads of
it, and then computed, that by his peculias Condu& in this
Embaffy, you should hear, within two or three Days, with-
out your leaving home, or undertaking any Expedition‚ or
giving yourselves the least Solicitude, that Thebes alone, with-
out an Invafion of the rest of Boeofia, was besieged 3 that
Thespiae and Plataea were again inhabited 3 that Apollo's T rea-
sures were repaid Him, not by the Phocaeans, but the The·
bans, who had themselves formed a Design of seizing his

committed the Sacrilege. Thus the rea-
soning is dire& and conclusive, which by
his Transsation is broken and imperfe&.
The Italian Transsator renders the Pas-

giving us ‚VVolfius his Transsation and
his Note without any Remark upon it,
