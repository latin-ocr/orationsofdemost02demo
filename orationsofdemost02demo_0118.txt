106 ORATION‘S OF

the Senate, and afterwards that of the People (while in those
Affemblies, in which you were to deliberate upon the Peace,
there were yet no Suspicions of their Conduet rumoured abroad,
nor any apparent Injury committed by them) according to the
Usages established by Law, I pronounced their Panegyric, and
invited thern to the Prytanaeum. Besides, Ι confess I entertained

Philip's Ambaffadors most hospitably3 indeed, O Men of
Athens, most splendidly. For having observed in Macedonia,

that they gloried in the Luxury of such Entertainments, as
Objeas of Happiness and Splendor, Iinstantly thought myself

obliged to affume a Superiority over them, and to display a
greater Spirit of Magnificence. But AEschines will urge it as an

Objeetion, and exclaim, “ Demosthenes himself pronounced
“ our Panegyric3 Demosthenes entertained Philip’s Ambaffa-
dorS‚'’ but without distinguishing the Date of these Facta.
T hey happened, however, before the Republic was injured3
before these Traitors had apparently sold themselves; when·
Philip’s Ambaffadors were but just arrived, and the People were>

yet to hear their Proposals; when AEschines had not openly
pleaded the Cause of Philocrates, and when he himself had not:
proposed his Decree. If he urges these Objec‘tion8‚ do you
remember the Date of these Transaetions3 that they preceded
their Crimes, and that afterwards I never had any Society with

them, any Communication. Read the Evidence.
