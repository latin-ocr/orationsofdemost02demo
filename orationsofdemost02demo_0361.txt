AGAINSTCTESIPHON. 349

How extravagant the Insolence of this Proceeding I shall en-
deavour to demonstrate by this one fignal Instance. The King
of Perfia, some little Time before Alexander's Expedition into
Asia, sent the People of Athens an affronting and barbarian
Letter, in which among other ill-mannered Expreffions he

wrote at the Conclufion, “ I shall give you no Gold3 impor-
“ tune me no more 3 you never shall receive any.” Yet this very
Monarch, when surrounded with Dangers‚ which still press hard

upon him, without any Request from the People of Athens vo—
luntarily sent them three hundred Talents, which with a no-
ble Moderation they refused to accept. Thus a critical Con-
junctum, his own Terrours, and his Want of Allies, offered to
us the Perfian Gold, and the very same Causes operated in our
Alliance with the Thebans. Yet you,' Demosthenes, are ever
clamoroussy repeating the Name of Thebes, and that unfortu-

nate AlHance, but are profoundly silent with Regard to the
seventy Talents of Perfian Gold, which you secreted for your
own Purposes. Yet was it not evidently for Want of Money,

even of five Talents‚ that their Mercenaries refused to deliver
up their Citadel to the Thebans? When the Arcadians had
taken the Field with all their Forces‚ and their Generals were

ready to enter upon Aetion, was not the whole Expedition lost,
meerly for Want of nine Talents ? However you are rich, and
able to support the Expence of your luxurious Pleasures. In
very Faffit, the royal Gold he reserves to himself, and leaves to
you the Dangers of his Administration.
