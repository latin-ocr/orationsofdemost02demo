DEMOSTHENES. 125
When Callias, for Iustance, was Ambaffador to Persia, as I

am persuaded you have heard, and had negotiated a Pcace,
which was applauded by all the States of Greece, and by which
the Perfian Monarch could not descend with any Body of
Forces nearer the Sea-Coasts‚ than the Distance, that an Horse
could run in a Day; nor approach by Sea to the Chalydonian‚.
or Cyanean Issands with any Veffel beyond a certain Bulk, yet
as he appeared to have accepted Presents in his Embafly‚ our
Ancestors had very nearly ordered his Execution, and in paffing
his Accounts fined him fifty Talents; though certainly the Re-
public never concluded, either before or afterwards, a Peacev
more honourable. But this circumstance they did not confider,
or they attributed it to their own Virtue‚ and the Authority
of the Commonwealth3 but whether their Ambaffador was
influenced by Money, they imputed to his own Mamers, which
they judged should be honest and uncorrupted, when engaging
in the Administration of public Affairs. So much did they
esteem Corruption an Enemy and pernicious to the State, as
not to suffer itin any Negotiation‚ however glorious, or in any
Person, however estimable. But. you, O Men of Athen5‚.
although you behold the very same Peace rasmg to the Ground
the Walls of your Consederate3‚ and building the Houses
of your Ambaffador33 taking away from the Republic her·
Poffeffions, and giving to them what they never hoped fort,
even in their Dreams‚ yet you do not order them to be put to·
Death⁹ but want an Accuser‚ and prosecute with Words those

Offcnccs,
